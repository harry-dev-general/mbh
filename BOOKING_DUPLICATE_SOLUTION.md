# Booking Duplicate Solution Guide

## Problem Overview
The webhook automation is creating duplicate records for each booking as it progresses through payment statuses:
- PEND (pending) → PART (partial payment) → PAID (fully paid)

This results in 2-3 records per booking, causing duplicates on calendars.

## Root Cause
The webhook automation creates a NEW record for every status change instead of updating the existing record.

## Solution Components

### 1. Immediate Calendar Fix
Update the calendar filtering to only show PAID bookings with amounts > $0:

```javascript
// In management-allocations.html and management-dashboard.html
bookingsData = bookingsData.filter(booking => {
    const status = booking.fields['Status'];
    const amount = booking.fields['Total Amount'] || 0;
    
    if (status === 'PAID') {
        const bookingItems = booking.fields['Booking Items'] || '';
        if (bookingItems === 'icebag') {
            return true; // Ice bags are legitimately $0
        }
        return amount > 0;
    }
    
    return status === 'Confirmed' || status === 'Pending';
});
```

### 2. Fix Webhook Automation
Replace your current Airtable webhook script with `airtable-webhook-fix-complete.js` which:
- Checks for existing bookings before creating new records
- Updates existing records when status changes
- Preserves staff assignments
- Automatically deletes duplicates when updating to PAID

### 3. Clean Up Existing Duplicates
Run `airtable-booking-deduplication-solution.js` in Airtable Scripting app to:
- Identify all duplicate bookings
- Keep only PAID records with highest amounts
- Merge staff assignments from duplicates
- Delete unnecessary duplicate records

### 4. Fix $0 PAID Bookings
Run `fix-zero-dollar-bookings.js` to identify PAID bookings that have $0 amounts but should have actual values.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Your Data
Export your Bookings Dashboard table before making changes.

### Step 2: Update Webhook Automation
1. Go to your Airtable automation
2. Replace the date/time processing script with `airtable-webhook-fix-complete.js`
3. Test with a sample webhook

### Step 3: Clean Existing Data
1. Create a new Scripting app in Airtable
2. Copy `airtable-booking-deduplication-solution.js`
3. Run to analyze duplicates
4. Review the output
5. Uncomment the cleanup section and run again

### Step 4: Fix $0 Amounts
1. Run `fix-zero-dollar-bookings.js` to identify problematic bookings
2. Manually update the amounts based on booking types

### Step 5: Update Calendar Filters (Optional)
If you want extra safety, update your calendar code to filter out problematic records.

## Verification
After implementation:
- New bookings should only create ONE record that gets updated
- Calendars should show no duplicates
- All PAID boat bookings should have proper amounts

## Maintenance
- Monitor new bookings to ensure no duplicates are created
- Check weekly for any $0 PAID bookings that need correction
- Consider adding amount validation in your webhook
