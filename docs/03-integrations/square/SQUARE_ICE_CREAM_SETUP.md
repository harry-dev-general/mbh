# Square Ice Cream Boat Sales Integration

**Date**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Configured and Ready

## Webhook Configuration

Your webhook is now configured with:
- **Signature Key**: `CPK571BwzDvZCy58EhV8FQ`
- **Subscription ID**: `wbhk_580abb9ed1d5478684ff5da3f269e21e`
- **Category Filter**: `Ice-Cream-Boat-Sales`

## How It Works

The webhook handler now:
1. ‚úÖ Verifies webhook signatures using your key
2. ‚úÖ Filters for only "Ice-Cream-Boat-Sales" category transactions
3. ‚úÖ Extracts ice cream boat details from orders
4. ‚úÖ Creates bookings in Airtable with proper categorization

## Ice Cream Sales Flow

Or add to local `.env`:
```

```

## Testing Ice Cream Sales

### 1. Create Test Sale in Square
- Use an item from "Ice-Cream-Boat-Sales" category
- Complete the payment

### 2. Monitor Logs
```bash
# Local
npm run dev

# Railway
railway logs -f
```

### 3. Expected Log Output

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid webhook signature" Error
- Verify `SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY` is set correctly
- Check Railway environment variables
- Restart server after adding key

### No Ice Cream Sales Recording
- Verify items are in "Ice-Cream-Boat-Sales" category
- Check category name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Review webhook logs for category check

### All Sales Being Recorded
- Check category filter is working
- Verify items are properly categorized in Square
- Look for "Checking order for Ice-Cream-Boat-Sales" in logs

## Next Steps

1. **Production Testing**
   - Make a real ice cream sale
   - Verify it appears in portal
   - Check add-on indicators show

2. **Staff Training**
   - Ensure ice cream items are categorized correctly
   - Train on Square POS for ice cream sales
   - Show how to view in portal

3. **Reporting**
   - Ice cream sales will be separate in Airtable
   - Can filter by "Ice Cream Boat Operations"
   - Track vessel-specific ice cream revenue
