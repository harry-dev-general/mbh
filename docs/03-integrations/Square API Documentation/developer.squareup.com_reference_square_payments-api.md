# Payments

The Payments API lets developers take and manage payments.

Applications need the following input to take a payment:

- The amount to charge.

- The payment recipient. The payment goes to the account identified by the Authorization header in the API request.

- The payment source. The source can be a payment token or card on file.

You can generate a payment token using the Web Payments SDK and the In-App Payments SDK. For working code examples, see [Square Connect API Examples](https://github.com/square/connect-api-examples).

A card on file is a credit card, debit card, or gift card that is associated with a customer.You can create a customer and add a card on file using Square APIs, the Square Seller Dashboard, or the Square Point of Sale application.
