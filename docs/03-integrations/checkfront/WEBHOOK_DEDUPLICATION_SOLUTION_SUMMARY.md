# Webhook Deduplication Solution Summary

## Problem Solved ✅
Multiple booking records were being created for each payment status change (PEND → PART → PAID), causing duplicate entries in calendar views and management dashboards.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced the webhook automation's "Create Record" action with a smart deduplication script that:
1. Checks if booking already exists
2. Updates existing record if found
3. Creates new record only if not found
4. Passes all data to SMS script for notification handling

## Key Files
- **Deduplication Script**: `airtable-webhook-fix-verified.js`
- **SMS Script**: `sms-script-optimized.js`

## Automation Flow
```
1. Webhook Trigger (from Checkfront)
   ↓
2. Deduplication Script
   - Checks for existing booking by code
   - Updates or creates record
   - Outputs all booking data + isUpdate flag
   ↓
3. SMS Script
   - Receives data from deduplication script
   - Sends appropriate notification based on status change
```

## Impact on Portal
- **Calendar Views**: Now show single entry per booking (no duplicates)
- **Staff Allocation**: Accurate booking counts without triplicates
- **Management Dashboard**: Clean, deduplicated booking data
- **No Portal Code Changes Required**: Existing calendar logic works perfectly with deduplicated data

## Testing Confirmed
- ✅ New bookings create single record
- ✅ Status updates modify existing record (no duplicates)
- ✅ SMS notifications sent appropriately
- ✅ Currency field conversion working ($550 stored correctly)

## Optional Follow-up Tasks
1. **Clean existing duplicates**: Run cleanup script to remove historical duplicates
2. **Fix $0 PAID bookings**: Identify and correct bookings showing as PAID with $0 amount
3. **Backup data**: Create backup before cleanup operations

## Date Implemented
January 2025

## Key Achievement
Solved the root cause of duplicate bookings without requiring any changes to the MBH Staff Portal codebase. The calendars now accurately display single entries per booking throughout the payment lifecycle.
