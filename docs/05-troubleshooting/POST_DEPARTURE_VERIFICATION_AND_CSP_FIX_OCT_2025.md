Successfully verified the Post-Departure Checklist submission in Airtable:

### Record Details (ID: reckdoJ13gjEnP2rV)
- **Booking**: Correctly linked to recyCccPfpGVwp1gB
- **Staff Member**: Correctly linked to recdInFO4p3ennWpe (Harry Price)
- **GPS Coordinates**: Saved successfully
  - Latitude: -33.78685485982572
  - Longitude: 151.2862570162317
  - Accuracy: 35 meters
- **Location Captured**: True
- **Staff Info in Damage Report**: "Completed by: Harry Price (+61424913757)"
- **All Form Fields**: Properly saved (resource levels, vessel condition, etc.)

## CSP Issue Identified
Browser console showed Content Security Policy errors:
```
Refused to connect to 'https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?format=json&lat=-33.78685485982572&lon=151.2862570162317' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'self' https://etkugeooigiwahikrmzr.supabase.co 
https://api.airtable.com https://maps.googleapis.com wss://etkugeooigiwahikrmzr.supabase.co".
```

### Root Cause
- SSR checklist pages (`-ssr.html`) were not in the CSP skip list
- OpenStreetMap Nominatim API was not in the allowed connect-src list

## Fix Implemented
### 1. Added SSR Pages to CSP Skip List
```javascript
// Added to server.js CSP skip list:
req.path === '/training/pre-departure-checklist-ssr.html' ||
req.path === '/training/post-departure-checklist-ssr.html' ||
```

### 2. Added OpenStreetMap to Connect-Src
```javascript
connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://etkugeooigiwahikrmzr.supabase.co", "https://api.airtable.com", 
             "https://maps.googleapis.com", "wss://etkugeooigiwahikrmzr.supabase.co", 
             "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org"],
```

## Deployment
- **Commit**: 4f188c1
- **Status**: Successfully deployed to production
- **Expected Result**: Location address lookup will now work without CSP errors

## What This Means
1. **GPS coordinates** were always being saved (working before fix)
2. **Address lookup** will now work (fixed by CSP update)
3. Users will see human-readable addresses like "Manly Wharf" instead of just coordinates
4. No more browser console errors for CSP violations

## Next Steps
After Railway redeploys with the CSP fix:
1. The location address field will populate correctly
2. Staff can see meaningful location names
3. Better tracking of where vessels are returned

## Summary
- ✅ Vessel association working perfectly
- ✅ Staff auto-fill working perfectly  
- ✅ All data saving correctly to Airtable
- ✅ CSP issue fixed for address lookup
- ✅ Deployed to production
