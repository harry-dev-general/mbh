# Pre/Post-Departure Checklist Loading Fix

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Issue**: Pre-departure and post-departure checklist pages getting stuck in loading animation  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

## Problem Summary

The pre-departure and post-departure checklist pages were failing to load with the following issues:

1. **Hardcoded Airtable API Key**: Client-side JavaScript was making direct Airtable API calls with a hardcoded API key
2. **CORS Restrictions**: Airtable doesn't allow direct browser requests, causing CORS errors
3. **No Management Fallback**: Pages required users to have employee records, with no support for management access
4. **Security Vulnerability**: Exposing Airtable API key in client-side code

## Root Cause

The checklist pages were using this pattern:
```javascript
// BAD: Direct Airtable API call from browser
const AIRTABLE_API_KEY = 'patYiJdXfvcSenMU4...'; // Hardcoded!
const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.airtable.com/v0/${BASE_ID}/tbltAE4NlNePvnkpY?filterByFormula={Email}='${email}'`,
    {
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${AIRTABLE_API_KEY}` // Won't work due to CORS
        }
    }
);
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Server-Side API Endpoints

Created `/api/checklist-api.js` with secure endpoints:
- `GET /api/checklist/employee-by-email` - Find employee by email
- `GET /api/checklist/assigned-bookings` - Get bookings (with management support)
- `GET /api/checklist/boat/:boatId` - Get boat details
- `POST /api/checklist/pre-departure-checklist` - Submit pre-departure checklist
- `POST /api/checklist/post-departure-checklist` - Submit post-departure checklist

### 2. Updated Checklist Pages

Created fixed versions:
- `/training/pre-departure-checklist-fixed.html`
- `/training/post-departure-checklist-fixed.html`

Key improvements:
- Load Supabase config from `/api/config` endpoint
- Use server-side API for all Airtable operations
- Support management mode when no employee record exists
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 3. Management Access Support

The fixed pages now support two modes:
- **Employee Mode**: Shows only assigned bookings
- **Management Mode**: Shows all bookings (activated when no employee record found)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Deploy the API Changes

The following files need to be deployed:
- `/api/checklist-api.js` (new file)
- `/server.js` (updated to include checklist API routes)

### 2. Replace the Checklist Pages

Replace the existing pages with the fixed versions:
```bash
# Backup originals
mv training/pre-departure-checklist.html training/pre-departure-checklist-old.html
mv training/post-departure-checklist.html training/post-departure-checklist-old.html

# Use fixed versions
mv training/pre-departure-checklist-fixed.html training/pre-departure-checklist.html
mv training/post-departure-checklist-fixed.html training/post-departure-checklist.html
```

### 3. Update Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Railway:
- `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` - Your Airtable API key
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - (Optional) For location features

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test with Employee Account
- Login with an employee email that exists in Airtable
- Should see only assigned bookings
- Can complete checklists for assigned bookings

### 2. Test with Management Account
- Login with an email that doesn't have an employee record
- Should see "Management View" badge
- Can see and complete checklists for ALL bookings

### 3. Test Direct Booking Links
- Access with booking ID: `/training/pre-departure-checklist.html?bookingId=rec3KoDMTOKicct1Q`
- Should auto-select that booking if user has access

## Key Changes

### Before (Broken)
```javascript
// Direct Airtable call from browser
const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.airtable.com/v0/${BASE_ID}/table`,
    { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${HARDCODED_KEY}` }}
);
```

### After (Fixed)
```javascript
// Server-side API call
const response = await fetch('/api/checklist/employee-by-email?email=' + email);
```

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Airtable API key no longer exposed in client code
2. **Reliability**: No more CORS issues
3. **Flexibility**: Management can complete any checklist
4. **Maintainability**: API endpoints can be updated without changing client code

## Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. ✅ Pages load without getting stuck
2. ✅ Employee lookup works correctly
3. ✅ Management mode activates for non-employees
4. ✅ Bookings display correctly
5. ✅ Checklists can be submitted successfully
6. ✅ Direct booking links work (`?bookingId=xxx`)

- `/training/pre-departure-checklist.html` - Fixed pre-departure page
- `/training/post-departure-checklist.html` - Fixed post-departure page
- `/server.js` - Updated with new routes

## Notes

- The `/api/config` endpoint already exists and returns necessary configuration
- Fixed pages maintain all original functionality
- Location tracking for post-departure remains intact
- Checklist ID generation follows format: "Vessel - Name - Date"
