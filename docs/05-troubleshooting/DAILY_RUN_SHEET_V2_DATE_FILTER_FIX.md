# Daily Run Sheet v2 - Date Filter Fix

## Issue
The daily run sheet calendar was not displaying any bookings, even though bookings existed in Airtable for the current date.

## Root Cause
The Airtable API filter was using direct date equality comparison:
```javascript
{Booking Date}='2025-10-29'
```

However, this doesn't work reliably with Airtable date fields. The filter would return 0 results even when bookings existed for that date.

## Solution
Updated the filter to use Airtable's `IS_SAME()` function for proper date comparison:
```javascript
IS_SAME({Booking Date}, '2025-10-29', 'day')
```

## Changes Made

### `/api/daily-run-sheet.js`
1. Updated the filter formula to use `IS_SAME()` function:
   ```javascript
   const statusFilter = `AND(OR({Status}='PAID', {Status}='PEND', {Status}='PART'), IS_SAME({Booking Date}, '${dateString}', 'day'))`;
   ```

2. Removed the manual JavaScript date filtering since filtering is now done in the Airtable query:
   ```javascript
   // Removed this code:
   const filteredBookings = allBookings.filter(booking => {
       const bookingDate = booking.fields['Booking Date'];
       return bookingDate === dateString;
   });
   ```

## Testing
After the fix, the API now correctly returns bookings for the specified date. For October 29, 2025, it returns:
- Test Customer
- Peter macnamara  
- Peter

## Key Learning
When filtering date fields in Airtable formulas, always use date-specific functions like `IS_SAME()` rather than direct equality comparison.
