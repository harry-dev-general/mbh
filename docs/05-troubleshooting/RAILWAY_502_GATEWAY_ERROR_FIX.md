# Railway 502 Bad Gateway Error - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
Date: October 15, 2025

**Error**: All requests returned 502 Bad Gateway with "Application failed to respond"

## Root Cause
The Express server was not explicitly binding to `0.0.0.0`, which Railway requires for proper routing. By default, Node.js/Express may bind to `localhost` (127.0.0.1), which is not accessible from Railway's edge proxy.

## Solution
Updated `server.js` to explicitly bind to `0.0.0.0`:

```javascript
// Railway requires binding to 0.0.0.0
const HOST = '0.0.0.0';
server.listen(PORT, HOST, () => {
  console.log(`MBH Staff Portal running on ${HOST}:${PORT}`);
  // ...
});
```

## Why This Happens
1. Railway runs applications in containers
2. The Railway edge proxy needs to connect to your app
3. `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` is only accessible within the container
4. `0.0.0.0` makes the app accessible from outside the container

## Verification
After deployment with this fix:
```bash
curl https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/api/test
# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","nodeEnv":"production","railwayEnv":"development"}
```

## Key Learnings
- Always bind to `0.0.0.0` for containerized deployments
- Railway's 502 errors often indicate connectivity issues, not application errors
- The application logs may show it's running fine, but it's not accessible

## Related Issues
This fix also resolves:
- Pages not loading at all
- Supabase initialization hanging (was never reached due to 502)
- All authentication issues (requests weren't reaching the server)
