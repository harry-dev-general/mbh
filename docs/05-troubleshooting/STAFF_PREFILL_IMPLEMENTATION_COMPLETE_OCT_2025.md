# Staff Pre-fill Implementation Complete - October 22, 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented automatic staff pre-fill functionality for MBH checklists using staffId parameter in SMS URLs. This follows the hybrid approach recommended in the analysis phase.

## Implementation Details

### 1. URL Parameter Addition
- Updated `api/booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed.js` to include `staffId` in checklist URLs:
  - Pre-departure: `/training/pre-departure-checklist-ssr.html?bookingId={bookingId}&staffId={staffId}`
  - Post-departure: `/training/post-departure-checklist-ssr.html?bookingId={bookingId}&staffId={staffId}`

### 2. Employee Data Fetching
- Added `fetchEmployee()` function in `api/checklist-renderer.js`
- Retrieves employee data from Airtable using the provided staffId
- Handles missing or invalid staffId gracefully

### 3. Form Pre-population
- When valid employee data is found:
  - Staff Name field is pre-populated with employee's name
  - Staff Phone field is pre-populated with employee's phone number
  - Both fields are made read-only with visual indicators
  - Shows "Auto-filled from your profile" helper text
  - Uses grayed-out styling to indicate non-editable fields

### 4. Data Submission
- Added hidden `employeeId` field to preserve the staff record ID
- Updated submission logic to include `Staff Member` linked record field
- Maintains backward compatibility - still includes staff info in Notes field

### 5. Error Handling
- Invalid or missing staffId results in empty, editable fields
- No errors shown to user - graceful fallback
- Console logging for debugging purposes

## Testing
Created comprehensive test script: `test-staff-prefill.js`
- Tests pre-filled fields with valid staffId
- Tests empty fields without staffId
- Tests handling of invalid staffId
- Covers both pre-departure and post-departure checklists

## Benefits
1. **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces manual entry errors
2. **Time Savings**: Staff don't need to type their details
3. **Better Tracking**: Direct link to staff record in Airtable
4. **User Experience**: Clear visual indication of auto-filled data
5. **Security**: Read-only fields prevent tampering

## Next Steps for Production
1. Update Airtable Staff table to ensure all active staff have phone numbers
2. Test with actual staff members and booking IDs
3. Monitor for any edge cases in production logs
4. Consider adding staff validation against booking assignments

## Files Modified
- `/api/booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed.js` - Added staffId to URLs
- `/api/checklist-renderer.js` - Implemented pre-fill logic
- `/test-staff-prefill.js` - Created test script
- Various documentation files

## Technical Notes
- Uses Airtable API to fetch employee records
- Maintains existing staff tracking in Notes field for compatibility
- Follows Railway deployment best practices
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
