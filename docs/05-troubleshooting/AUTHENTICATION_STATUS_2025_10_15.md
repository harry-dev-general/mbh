# MBH Staff Portal Authentication Status Report
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING

## Infrastructure Status âœ…
- Server is accessible at https://mbh-development.up.railway.app
- All API endpoints are responding correctly
- Server properly bound to 0.0.0.0 (502 error FIXED)
- All environment variables properly configured
- Static files served correctly (remember: no /training prefix in URLs)

## Authentication Flow Status ðŸŸ¡

### Working Components âœ…
1. **JWT Verification**: Properly rejecting invalid tokens
2. **API Endpoints**: All authentication endpoints responding
3. **Role Sync Endpoint**: Successfully reading from Airtable
4. **Supabase Integration**: Fixed with timeout handling in `supabase-init-fix.js`

### Issues Identified ðŸ”´

1. **Missing Staff Profiles**:
   - 7 users in auth.users table
   - Only 1 user (harry@priceoffice.com.au) has a staff_profiles record
   - Other users need to log in to trigger profile creation

2. **Role Sync Limitation**:
   - Sync endpoint finds employees in Airtable but can't create profiles for users who haven't logged in
   - Need to implement profile creation during sync, not just role updates

3. **Email Mismatch**:
   - harry@priceoffice.com.au: Admin in Supabase
   - harry@kursol.io: Casual in Airtable
   - This suggests duplicate accounts or data inconsistency

## Current User Status

### Users with Profiles:
- harry@priceoffice.com.au (Admin) âœ…

### Users without Profiles (need to log in):
- walkerjcourtney@gmail.com (Casual in Airtable)
- bronte.sprouster07@icloud.com (Casual in Airtable)
- joshyvasco@gmail.com (Full Time/Admin in Airtable)
- mmckelvey03@gmail.com (Full Time/Admin in Airtable)
- harry@kursol.io (Casual in Airtable)
- boathiremanly@gmail.com (Not in Airtable sync)

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Test login flow with harry@priceoffice.com.au to verify admin routing
2. **Short-term**: Update role sync to create profiles for existing users
3. **Long-term**: Resolve duplicate Harry accounts
4. **Testing**: Have other users log in to create their profiles

2. Verify role-based dashboard routing works
3. Update role sync to handle profile creation
4. Document any remaining issues
