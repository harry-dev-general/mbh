# Reminder Recipients Fix - October 23, 2025

## Issue Summary
After implementing the fix to only mark reminders as sent after successful SMS delivery, both onboarding and deloading reminders stopped sending entirely.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem Flow:
1. System checks if reminder should be sent
2. Creates empty `recipients` Set
3. Tries to add employees to the Set
4. If no recipients found (empty Set), the loop doesn't execute
5. `sentCount` remains 0
6. Reminder is NOT marked as sent
7. System retries every minute but never sends anything

### Why Recipients Were Empty:
- No employees assigned to bookings (`Onboarding Employee` / `Deloading Employee` fields empty)
- Full-time staff query might be failing or returning empty
- Potential issue with Set operations on Airtable record objects

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging to track:
- Number of assigned employees found
- Each employee added to recipients
- Total recipients count
- Success/failure for each SMS sent

### 2. Prevent Infinite Retry Loop
If no recipients are found:
- Log a warning
- Mark the reminder as sent anyway to prevent retry loop
- This prevents the system from checking the same booking every minute

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Log specific error messages when SMS sending fails
- Track both success and failure counts
- Show which staff members received/didn't receive SMS

## Code Changes

### Before:
```javascript
const recipients = new Set();
// ... add recipients ...
if (sentCount > 0) {
    await markReminderSent(booking.id, 'onboarding');
} else {
    console.log(`⚠️ No onboarding reminders sent - will retry next cycle`);
}
```

### After:
```javascript
const recipients = new Set();
// ... add recipients with logging ...

// If no recipients found, prevent infinite retry
if (recipients.size === 0) {
    console.log(`⚠️ No recipients found - marking as sent to prevent retry loop`);
    await markReminderSent(booking.id, 'onboarding');
    continue;
}

// ... send with detailed logging ...
```

## Expected Behavior
1. System will now log exactly what's happening with recipients
2. If no recipients exist, reminder is marked as sent to prevent loops
3. If recipients exist but all SMS fail, system will retry
4. Clear visibility into why reminders might not be sending

## Next Steps
1. Monitor logs to see recipient details
2. Verify full-time staff are being fetched correctly
3. Check if bookings have assigned employees
4. Ensure SMS API is working properly
