# Vessel Status Update - Overall Condition Field Fix

**Date**: September 16, 2025
**Issue**: Overall Condition field updates failing with permissions/validation errors

## Problem Description

When updating vessel status through the management dashboard, the "Overall Condition" field was causing two sequential errors:

1. **First Error**: "Insufficient permissions to create new select option 'Ready for Use'"
2. **Second Error**: "Invalid condition value" (400 status code)

## Root Cause

The issue was a mismatch between three different sets of field values:

1. **HTML form options** (incorrect values)
2. **Server-side validation** (different incorrect values)  
3. **Airtable single select field** (actual valid values)

## Solution

Updated both the HTML form and server-side validation to match Airtable's actual field options:

### Valid Overall Condition Values
- `Good - Ready for Next Booking`
- `Needs Attention` 
- `Major Issues - Do Not Use`

### Files Modified
1. `/training/management-dashboard.html` - Updated select options
2. `/api/routes/vessel-maintenance.js` - Updated validConditions array

## Technical Details

The Post-Departure Checklist table (`tblYkbSQGP6zveYNi`) has a single select field called "Overall Vessel Condition After Use" that only accepts the three specific values above. 

When values don't match exactly, Airtable returns either:
- A permissions error (if it tries to create a new option)
- A validation error (if the server rejects it first)

## Testing

After the fix, vessel status updates should work correctly for all fields:
- Fuel Level
- Gas Level  
- Water Level
- Overall Condition

## Prevention

When working with Airtable single/multi-select fields:
1. Always verify the exact field options using the Airtable MCP tool
2. Ensure client-side and server-side validation match exactly
3. Test with actual data before deployment
