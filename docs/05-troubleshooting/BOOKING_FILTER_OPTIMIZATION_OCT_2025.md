# Booking Filter Optimization - October 2025

## Overview
Updated the booking fetch logic in `/management-allocations.html` to only retrieve relevant bookings that need to be displayed and managed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Filtering (Airtable API)
**Previous Implementation:**
- Fetched bookings with Status: 'PAID', 'PART', 'Confirmed', or 'Pending'
- No date filtering - fetched all bookings regardless of date

**New Implementation:**
- Only fetch bookings with Status = 'PAID'
- Only fetch bookings with Booking Date >= today
- Uses Airtable formula: `AND({Status}='PAID', {Booking Date} >= 'YYYY-MM-DD')`

### 2. Client-Side Filtering
**Previous Implementation:**
```javascript
if (status !== 'PAID' && status !== 'PART' && status !== 'Confirmed') {
    return false;
}
```

**New Implementation:**
```javascript
if (status !== 'PAID') {
    console.log('Booking excluded due to non-PAID status:', status, record.fields['Customer Name']);
    return false;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Reduces data transfer by not fetching completed/past bookings
2. **Clarity**: Only shows bookings that are actionable (PAID status)
3. **Efficiency**: Reduces client-side processing of irrelevant records
4. **Accuracy**: Ensures staff only see bookings they need to manage

## Technical Details

### Date Filtering
- Uses `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` to get today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- This format matches Airtable's date field format for proper comparison
- The filter ensures we only get bookings for today and future dates

### Status Filtering
- Removed support for:
  - 'PART' (partial payment)
  - 'Confirmed' (confirmed but not paid)
  - 'Pending' (pending status)
- Now only fetches 'PAID' bookings which are ready for operations

### Logging
Added console logging to track:
- Today's date used for filtering
- Number of PAID bookings fetched
- Any bookings excluded due to non-PAID status

## Impact
This change ensures that the management allocations page only displays bookings that:
1. Have been fully paid (Status = 'PAID')
2. Are scheduled for today or in the future
3. Are actionable by staff for allocation and management

Past bookings and non-paid bookings will no longer appear in the calendar view, reducing clutter and improving focus on current operations.
