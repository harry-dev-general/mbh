# Checklist Loading Error Fix - October 2025

## Issue Description
Regular staff members were unable to access checklists via the `/my-schedule.html` page. When clicking on a checklist button that redirected to `/pre-departure-checklist.html?bookingId=recCiZzWUELrXKOri`, they encountered an error: "Error loading bookings. Please try again."

### Error Details
- **Status Code**: 500 (Internal Server Error)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/checklist/assigned-bookings`
- **Request Parameters**: 
  - `type=pre-departure`
  - `isManagement=false`
  - `employeeId=recU2yfUOIGFsIuZV`
  - `bookingId=recCiZzWUELrXKOri`

### Console Logs
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
Error loading bookings: Error: Failed to fetch bookings
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Variable Name Typo
**Location**: `/api/checklist-api.js`, line 97

The code was using `filterByFormula` instead of `filterFormula` when making the Airtable API request:

```javascript
// INCORRECT - variable doesn't exist
params: {
    filterByFormula,  // This should be filterByFormula: filterFormula
    sort: [...],
    pageSize: 100
}
```

### 2. Boolean String Parsing Issue
**Location**: `/api/checklist-api.js`, line 76

The `isManagement` parameter was being passed as a string ('true' or 'false') from the frontend but was being used as a boolean in the backend:

```javascript
// INCORRECT - string 'false' is truthy in JavaScript
const { employeeId, type, bookingId, isManagement } = req.query;
// Later in code:
if (employeeId && !isManagement) {  // !isManagement would be false for string 'false'
```

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Fixed Variable Name
Changed line 97 to properly reference the filter formula:
```javascript
params: {
    filterByFormula: filterFormula,  // Now correctly references the variable
    sort: [...],
    pageSize: 100
}
```

### 2. Fixed Boolean Parsing
Changed parameter extraction to properly parse the boolean string:
```javascript
const { employeeId, type, bookingId } = req.query;
const isManagement = req.query.isManagement === 'true';  // Now correctly parses boolean
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Regular Staff Access**:
   - Login as a regular staff member
   - Navigate to `/my-schedule.html`
   - Click on a checklist button for an assigned allocation
   - Verify the checklist loads without errors

2. **Management Access**:
   - Login as a management user
   - Access checklists to ensure management mode still works correctly
   - Verify all bookings are visible (not filtered by employee)

3. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Test with invalid booking IDs
   - Test with unassigned bookings
   - Verify appropriate error messages are shown
