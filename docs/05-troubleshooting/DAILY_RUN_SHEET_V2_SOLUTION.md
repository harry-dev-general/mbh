# Daily Run Sheet v2 - Calendar Events Not Displaying - SOLUTION

## Executive Summary

The Daily Run Sheet v2 calendar events are not displaying due to an incompatibility between the FullCalendar Scheduler plugin (loaded via CDN) and the GPL license key. Events are successfully created and exist in the calendar's memory but fail to render visually.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
- **FullCalendar Scheduler v6.1.8** is loaded from CDN
- Using GPL license key: `GPL-My-Project-Is-Open-Source`
- The scheduler plugin appears to load but doesn't properly initialize for event rendering
- Events are added to calendar memory but not rendered to the DOM

### Evidence
1. **Browser inspection revealed**:
   - `hasScheduler: false` - Scheduler plugin not properly initialized
   - `hasResourcePlugin: false` - Resource functionality not available
   - `eventsInDOM: 0` - No events rendered in the DOM
   - `eventsInMemory: 10` - Events exist in calendar object

2. **Console logs show**:
   - Events are created with correct dates and resource IDs
   - `calendar.addEvent()` succeeds for all events
   - Resources (vessels) display correctly
   - But NO visual event rendering occurs

## Solution Implemented

After extensive debugging and comparison with the working `management-allocations.html` implementation, the solution was to completely remove all resource/scheduler functionality and use standard FullCalendar.

### Changes Applied:

1. **Updated HTML** (`/training/daily-run-sheet-v2.html`):
```html
<!-- Changed to match working implementation -->
<link href='https://unpkg.com/fullcalendar@6.1.19/index.global.min.css' rel='stylesheet' />
<script src='https://unpkg.com/fullcalendar@6.1.19/index.global.min.js'></script>
```

2. **Complete JavaScript Refactor** (`daily-run-sheet-calendar.js`):
   - Removed ALL resource-specific code
   - Removed `schedulerLicenseKey` configuration
   - Removed `getVesselResources()` function
   - Removed `renderResourceLabel()` function
   - Changed `initialView` from `resourceTimelineDay` to `timeGridDay`
   - Updated event transformation to match working implementation pattern
   - Fixed event structure to use ISO strings for dates
   - Included vessel names directly in event titles

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Calendar Initialization Pattern
Matched the working implementation exactly:
```javascript
this.calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
    initialView: isMobile ? 'listDay' : 'timeGridDay',
    timeZone: 'Australia/Sydney',
    // Standard configuration without resource-specific options
});

this.calendar.render();
this.updateCalendarEvents(); // Load events AFTER rendering
```

### 2. Event Update Pattern  
Following management-allocations approach:
```javascript
updateCalendarEvents() {
    this.calendar.removeAllEvents();
    const events = this.transformToCalendarEvents();
    events.forEach(event => {
        this.calendar.addEvent(event);
    });
}
```

### 3. Event Structure Changes
```javascript
// Fixed event structure to match working implementation:
{
    id: `booking-${booking.id}`,
    title: `üõ•Ô∏è ${booking.customerName} (${vesselName})`,
    start: startDate.toISOString(), // ISO string format
    end: endDate.toISOString(),     // ISO string format
    backgroundColor: '#2196F3',
    borderColor: '#1976D2',
    classNames: ['booking-event', 'booking-main'],
    extendedProps: {
        recordType: 'booking', // Matches management-allocations pattern
        booking: booking,
        vesselName: vesselName,
        status: booking.status
    }
}
```

## Testing Notes

**Important**: The fix has been implemented locally but needs to be deployed to Railway for testing. The production server may be caching the old JavaScript files.

## Alternative Solutions if Issue Persists

1. **Clear Cache**:
   - Add cache-busting query parameters to JS/CSS files
   - Force refresh on the server

2. **Simplified Calendar**:
   - Use a basic table view instead of FullCalendar
   - Implement a custom timeline with CSS Grid

3. **Different Calendar Library**:
   - Consider alternatives like DayPilot (has free version)
   - Or Toast UI Calendar

## Update: Date Format Issue

After the initial fix, events were still not displaying. Further investigation revealed a timezone/date format issue:

**Problem**: Using `.toISOString()` returns UTC timestamps (e.g., "2025-10-29T01:00:00.000Z") which FullCalendar was interpreting incorrectly.

**Solution**: Changed to match the working implementation's date format:
- Use local date/time strings: `${booking.bookingDate}T${this.convertTo24Hour(booking.startTime)}`
- Added helper functions `convertTo24Hour()` and `addMinutes()` from working implementation
- This creates strings like "2025-10-29T12:00:00" without timezone suffix

## Update: Event Content and Final Timezone Fix

Events appeared but were blank and still at wrong times (11 PM instead of 12 PM).

**Problems Found**:
1. Property name mismatch: `renderEvent()` expected `props.type` but we set `props.recordType`
2. Calendar timezone setting still caused conversion

**Solutions Applied**:
1. Updated `renderEvent()` and `getEventClasses()` to check both property names
2. Changed calendar timezone from `'Australia/Sydney'` to `'local'`
3. Added fallback content to ensure events always display something

## Final Status

As of October 29, 2025, the calendar is functional with:
- ‚úÖ Events display with proper content
- ‚úÖ Events appear at correct times
- ‚úÖ Day and Week views work correctly
- ‚ùå Resource/Timeline view not available (requires commercial license)

## Next Steps

1. Monitor production deployment
2. Consider purchasing Scheduler license for resource view
3. Implement vessel filter dropdown as alternative to resource columns
