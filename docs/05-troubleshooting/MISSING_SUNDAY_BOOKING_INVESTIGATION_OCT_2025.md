# Missing Sunday Booking Investigation - October 2025

## Issue Description
A booking for Minh Mai on Sunday, October 26, 2025, was not appearing on the `/management-allocations.html` page's Weekly Calendar component, despite existing in Airtable.

## Investigation Details

### Booking Information (from Airtable)
- **Customer**: Minh Mai
- **Booking Date**: 2025-10-26 (Sunday)
- **Status**: PAID
- **Booking Code**: JMAN-141025
- **Time**: 08:30 am - 04:30 pm (8 hours)
- **Onboarding Employee**: Bronte Sprouster (recyoRnqUxVuMjW17)
- **Deloading Employee**: Joshua John Vasco (recxBgElxxfxyp2SN)
- **Boat**: recNyQ4NXCEtZAaW0

### Console Logs Showed
- Page looking for bookings between 2025-10-20 and 2025-10-26
- Found 100 PAID/PART bookings total
- Found 11 bookings for current week
- But Minh Mai's booking was not appearing in the calendar

## Root Causes Investigated

### 1. Client-Side Status Filter (PARTIALLY FIXED)
The original code was filtering for only 'PAID' or 'PART' status bookings:
```javascript
if (status !== 'PAID' && status !== 'PART') {
    return false;
}
```

We updated this to include 'Confirmed' status:
```javascript
if (status !== 'PAID' && status !== 'PART' && status !== 'Confirmed') {
    return false;
}
```

However, since Minh Mai's booking has 'PAID' status, this was not the issue.

### 2. Calendar Week View Configuration
The calendar is configured with:
- `firstDay: 1` (Monday as first day)
- Week view should show Monday through Sunday
- Time slots from 06:00:00 to 24:00:00

### 3. Debug Logging Added
1. **Booking Filter Debug**: Added logging for Minh Mai bookings in the filter function
2. **Calendar Transform Debug**: Added logging in `transformBookingsToEvents` function
3. **Sunday Events Debug**: Added specific logging for Sunday events
4. **Calendar Date Range Debug**: Added logging to show what dates the calendar is displaying
5. **Comprehensive Customer Name Logging**: Added logging to display ALL customer names in bookings
6. **Case-Insensitive Name Matching**: Updated Minh Mai detection to check for variations (lowercase "minh" or "mai")

## Current Status - RESOLVED
The issue has been identified and fixed!

### Root Cause
The `/management-allocations.html` page was only fetching the first 100 bookings from Airtable due to the API's default pagination limit. The console logs showed exactly 100 bookings being retrieved, and Minh Mai's booking was beyond this limit.

### Verification
Using the Airtable MCP, we confirmed Minh Mai's booking EXISTS with:
- Customer Name: "Minh Mai"
- Booking Date: "2025-10-26" (Sunday)
- Status: "PAID"
- Booking Code: "JMAN-141025"

### Solution Implemented
Added pagination support to the `loadBookings()` function to fetch ALL bookings from Airtable:
```javascript
// Handle pagination to get ALL bookings
let offset = data.offset;
while (offset) {
    console.log('Fetching more bookings with offset:', offset);
    const nextResponse = await fetchWithRetry(/* ... with offset parameter ... */);
    // ... append records and update offset
}
```

### Debug Logging Added
The following comprehensive debug logging was added:
- Total bookings fetched from Airtable (will now show > 100)
- Specific check for Minh/Mai bookings in raw data
- All customer names and their status/date
- Sunday-specific bookings with full details
- Case-insensitive matching for names containing "minh" or "mai"

## Testing the Fix
1. The user should refresh the `/management-allocations.html` page
2. Check the console logs for:
   - **"Total bookings fetched from Airtable:"** - Should now show more than 100
   - **"Found Minh/Mai bookings in raw data:"** - Should find Minh Mai's booking
   - **"Minh/Mai booking:"** - Will show the booking details
   - **"All customer names in bookings:"** - Should now include "Minh Mai"
   - **"Sunday (2025-10-26) bookings:"** - Should include Minh Mai's booking

3. The calendar should now display Minh Mai's booking on Sunday, October 26, 2025

## Code Changes Made
1. **Added Airtable Pagination**: Modified `loadBookings()` function to fetch ALL records using Airtable's offset-based pagination
2. **Updated Status Filter**: Included 'Confirmed' status in addition to 'PAID' and 'PART' 
3. **Added Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the booking processing pipeline
4. **Deployed to Production**: All changes have been pushed to the main branch
