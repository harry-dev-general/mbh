# Allocation Display Issue - Complete Resolution

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Issue**: Test Staff allocation for October 12, 2025 not displaying on Weekly Schedule calendar  
**Status**: RESOLVED âœ…

## Summary

The issue where Test Staff allocations were not displaying on the Weekly Schedule calendar has been fully resolved. The root cause was that allocations scheduled after 8 PM were outside the calendar's visible time range.

## Root Cause

The Test Staff allocation was scheduled for **21:00-23:00 (9 PM - 11 PM)**, but the FullCalendar was configured to only display times up to **20:00 (8 PM)**.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Extended Calendar Time Range
Changed the calendar configuration:
```javascript
// From:
slotMaxTime: '20:00:00',  // Only showed until 8 PM

// To:
slotMaxTime: '24:00:00',  // Now shows until midnight
```

### 2. Added Australian Date Format
Configured calendar to display dates in DD/MM format:
```javascript
locale: 'en-AU',
dayHeaderFormat: { weekday: 'short', day: 'numeric', month: 'numeric' },
titleFormat: { day: 'numeric', month: 'short', year: 'numeric' },
```

### 3. Migrated to Client-Side Filtering
Updated allocation loading to use client-side filtering instead of Airtable's unreliable `filterByFormula`:
- Fetch ALL allocations with pagination
- Filter dates in JavaScript
- Consistent with production environment

### 4. Added Time Validation
Implemented validation to prevent invalid time entries:
- End time must be after start time
- Shows clear error message
- Prevents negative duration allocations

### 5. Enhanced Manual Refresh
Improved the refresh button functionality:
- Shows loading state
- Reloads both allocations and bookings
- Forces complete calendar re-render

## Verification

The user has confirmed the fix is working correctly with console logs showing:
- 2 allocations found for the current week
- Test Staff events successfully created and added to calendar
- Calendar properly displaying all allocations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always consider time range limits** when events aren't displaying
2. **Client-side filtering is more reliable** than Airtable's filterByFormula for dates
3. **Debug logging is essential** for tracking down display issues
4. **Time zone handling** must be consistent throughout the application

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider making the calendar time range configurable
2. Add visual indicators when events are outside visible hours
3. Implement comprehensive error logging for production
4. Document all Airtable API quirks and workarounds

The Weekly Schedule calendar is now fully functional and displaying all allocations correctly.
