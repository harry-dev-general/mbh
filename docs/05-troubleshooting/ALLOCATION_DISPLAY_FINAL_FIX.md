# Allocation Display Issue - Final Resolution

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Issue**: Test Staff allocation not displaying despite existing in Airtable  

## Summary of Investigation

After thorough investigation, we discovered:

1. **Date Format**: NOT the issue
   - Airtable stores dates in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2025-10-12")
   - Our code correctly uses the same format
   - The calendar header showing MM/DD was only a display issue

2. **Data Loading**: Working correctly
   - Test Staff allocation EXISTS in Airtable with correct data
   - Week range calculation is CORRECT (Oct 6-12, 2025)
   - Client-side filtering is WORKING (finds 2 allocations including Test Staff)

3. **Time Recording**: No issue found
   - HTML5 time inputs return 24-hour format
   - Times are saved directly without conversion
   - No AM/PM conversion happening

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Calendar Locale Settings
Added Australian locale configuration to display dates in DD/MM format:
```javascript
// Date Formatting for Australian locale (DD/MM)
locale: 'en-AU',
dayHeaderFormat: { weekday: 'short', day: 'numeric', month: 'numeric' },
titleFormat: { day: 'numeric', month: 'short', year: 'numeric' },
```

### 2. Enhanced Calendar Refresh
Improved calendar refresh to force complete re-render:
```javascript
// Force a complete re-render by switching views
const currentView = calendar.view.type;
calendar.changeView('timeGridDay');
calendar.changeView(currentView);
updateCalendarEvents();
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Allocations loaded from Airtable
- Event transformation process
- Calendar update status

### 4. Improved Manual Refresh
Enhanced the refresh button to:
- Show loading state
- Reload both allocations and bookings
- Force complete calendar re-render
- Provide visual feedback

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Look for "Found X allocations for week"
   - Verify Test Staff allocation is listed
   - Check "Created X allocation events"

2. **Use Refresh Button**:
   - Click the üîÑ Refresh button
   - Should show "‚è≥ Refreshing..." while loading
   - Calendar should update with all allocations

3. **Create New Allocation**:
   - Calendar now forces complete refresh after creation
   - New allocations should appear immediately

## Root Cause

The issue was likely with FullCalendar's event rendering, not data loading. The calendar wasn't properly refreshing its view after data updates. The view-switching trick forces FullCalendar to completely re-render all events.

## Time Recording Clarification

The reported issue about "Start Time being incorrectly recorded as PM" was not reproducible:
- Time inputs use HTML5 `type="time"` which returns 24-hour format
- No conversion is applied when saving to Airtable
- Times are displayed correctly in the allocation data

If times appear incorrect, check:
1. Browser's time input behavior
2. System time format settings
3. Actual values stored in Airtable
