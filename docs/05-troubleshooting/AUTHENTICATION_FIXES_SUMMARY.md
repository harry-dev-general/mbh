# MBH Staff Portal - Authentication Fixes Summary
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Session**: Authentication System Fix Completion

## Fixes Applied Today

### 1. Supabase Initialization Timeout Fix âœ…
- **Problem**: `index.html` was hanging on Supabase `getSession()` calls
- **Solution**: Applied the `supabase-init-fix.js` module from `index-fixed.html`
- **Result**: Authentication checks now have proper timeout handling

### 2. Redirect URL Fixes âœ…
- **Problem**: Redirects were using `/training/auth.html` which doesn't work due to Express static file serving
- **Solution**: Changed all redirects to use root-level URLs (e.g., `/auth.html`)
- **Files Updated**: `training/index.html`

## Current Authentication Status

### âœ… Working Components
1. **Infrastructure**: Server accessible, properly bound to 0.0.0.0
2. **API Endpoints**: All authentication endpoints responding correctly
3. **JWT Verification**: Properly validating and rejecting invalid tokens
4. **Role Sync**: Successfully reading from Airtable (5 employees found)
5. **Supabase Client**: Fixed initialization with timeout handling

### ðŸŸ¡ Partial Issues
1. **Staff Profiles**: Only 1 of 7 users has a staff_profile record
   - Users need to log in to trigger profile creation
   - Role sync can't create profiles for users who haven't logged in

2. **Email Inconsistency**: 
   - harry@priceoffice.com.au (Admin in Supabase)
   - harry@kursol.io (Casual in Airtable)

## Authentication Flow

### Current Flow:
1. User visits https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/
2. `index.html` loads with fixed Supabase initialization
3. If no session â†’ redirect to `/auth.html`
4. If session exists â†’ check permissions via `/api/user/permissions`
5. Route to appropriate dashboard based on role

### Key URLs (Remember: NO /training prefix):
- Main App: https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/
- Login: https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/auth.html
- Dashboard: https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/dashboard.html
- Management: https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/management-dashboard.html

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Test Live Login**: Have harry@priceoffice.com.au log in to verify admin routing
2. **Profile Creation**: Update role sync to create staff_profiles for existing users
3. **Data Cleanup**: Resolve duplicate Harry accounts
4. **User Migration**: Have other staff members log in to create their profiles

## Technical Notes

### Static File Serving
- Files in `/training/` directory are served at root level
- Example: `/training/auth.html` â†’ accessible at `/auth.html`
- This is due to: `app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'training')))`

### Environment Variables (All Set in Railway)
- SUPABASE_URL âœ…
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY âœ…
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY âœ…
- AIRTABLE_API_KEY âœ…
- APP_URL âœ…
- NODE_ENV=production âœ…
- RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=development âœ…
