# Checklist Submission Fixes - October 22, 2025

## Issue Report
User reported that after submitting a Post-Departure Checklist:
1. No vessel was linked to the submission
2. No checklist ID was generated
3. Location Address field was empty
4. CSP error prevented OpenStreetMap API calls

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Vessel Link
The checklist submission was not fetching the booking data to retrieve the vessel information from the `Boat` field.

### 2. Missing Checklist ID
No unique identifier was being generated for checklist submissions.

### 3. Empty Location Address
Content Security Policy (CSP) was blocking calls to `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org` for reverse geocoding.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Checklist ID Generation
Created a function to generate unique checklist IDs in the format:
- Pre-Departure: `PRE-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-XXXX`
- Post-Departure: `POST-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-XXXX`

```javascript
function generateChecklistId(checklistType, bookingId) {
    const prefix = checklistType === 'Pre-Departure' ? 'PRE' : 'POST';
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[-:T.]/g, '').slice(0, 14);
    const randomStr = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 6).toUpperCase();
    return `${prefix}-${timestamp}-${randomStr}`;
}
```

### 2. Fixed Vessel Linking
Modified `handleChecklistSubmission` to:
1. Fetch booking data before submission
2. Extract the `Boat` field (linked record)
3. Include it as `Vessel` in the checklist submission

```javascript
// Fetch booking data to get vessel information
const bookingData = await fetchBooking(bookingId);

// In fields object:
...(bookingData && bookingData.fields && bookingData.fields['Boat'] && bookingData.fields['Boat'].length > 0 ? 
    {'Vessel': bookingData.fields['Boat']} : {}),
```

### 3. CSP Configuration
The CSP configuration in `server.js` already includes `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org` in the `connect-src` directive, and the SSR checklist pages are in the CSP skip list. The CSP error may be a browser-level issue or require clearing cache.

## Updated Field Mapping

Both Pre-Departure and Post-Departure checklists now include:
- `Checklist ID`: Unique identifier
- `Vessel`: Linked record from booking's `Boat` field
- `Staff Member`: Linked record when `employeeId` is provided

## Testing

Created `test-checklist-fixes.js` to verify:
1. Booking has vessel information
2. Checklist submission includes all required fields
3. Data is correctly saved to Airtable

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these fixes to production
2. Test with actual bookings
3. Monitor for CSP issues - may need to investigate browser-specific CSP handling
4. Consider adding server-side reverse geocoding as a fallback if client-side continues to fail
