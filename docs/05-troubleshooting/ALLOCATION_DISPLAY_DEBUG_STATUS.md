# Allocation Display Debug Status

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Issue**: Test Staff allocation not displaying on calendar despite existing in Airtable

## Investigation Summary

### What We Know:
1. **Data is Loading Correctly**:
   - Found 2 allocations for week 2025-10-06 to 2025-10-12
   - Test Staff allocation exists with all required fields
   - Joshua's allocation displays correctly

2. **Allocation Details** (from debug script):
   ```
   Test Staff Allocation:
   - Record ID: recLtmGIuKCo52mrU
   - Name: 2025-10-12 - Test Staff
   - Shift Date: 2025-10-12
   - Start Time: 21:00
   - End Time: 23:00
   - Employee ID: recU2yfUOIGFsIuZV (exists in staff table)
   - Response Status: Not set
   
   Joshua Allocation:
   - Record ID: recOCiIfH29ylh9sM
   - Name: 2025-10-11 - Joshua John Vasco
   - Shift Date: 2025-10-11
   - Start Time: 07:30
   - End Time: 08:30
   - Employee ID: recxBgElxxfxyp2SN (exists in staff table)
   - Response Status: Accepted
   ```

3. **Key Difference**:
   - Joshua's allocation has Response Status: "Accepted"
   - Test Staff allocation has Response Status: "Not set"

### Debug Logging Added:

I've added comprehensive logging to help diagnose the issue:

1. **In transformAllocationsToEvents()**:
   - Logs each allocation being processed
   - Shows if employee is found in staffData
   - Logs the complete event object created
   
2. **In updateCalendarEvents()**:
   - Shows total events being added
   - Specifically tracks Test Staff events
   - Logs any errors during event addition

### Next Steps for User:

1. **Reload the page and check console for new logs**:
   - Look for "Transforming allocations to events"
   - Check "Processing allocation: 2025-10-12 - Test Staff"
   - See if "Successfully added Test Staff event" appears
   
2. **Check for these specific issues**:
   - Is staffData populated when transforming allocations?
   - Is the Test Staff event being created?
   - Are there any errors when adding the event to calendar?

### Potential Causes:

1. **FullCalendar Filtering**: The calendar might be filtering out events based on:
   - Time range (21:00-23:00 might be outside visible hours)
   - Event validation rules
   - CSS hiding certain event types

2. **Staff Data Loading**: Despite using Promise.all, staffData might not be fully populated when events are transformed

3. **Response Status**: The "Not set" status might be causing the event to be styled or handled differently

### Immediate Fix to Try:

If the issue is the late time (21:00-23:00), try:
```javascript
// In calendar configuration
slotMaxTime: '24:00:00', // Currently set to '20:00:00'
```

This would make the calendar show 24 hours instead of stopping at 8 PM.
