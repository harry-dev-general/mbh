# Reminder Bug Fix Deployment - October 23, 2025

## Issue Fixed
Deloading reminders were being marked as sent without actually sending SMS messages.

## Root Cause
The scheduler was marking reminders as sent BEFORE attempting to send SMS messages. If SMS sending failed (no recipients, API error, etc.), the reminder was still marked as sent, preventing future attempts.

## Solution Implemented

### Before (Buggy Code):
```javascript
// Mark as sent FIRST to prevent duplicates
const marked = await markReminderSent(booking.id, 'deloading');

if (marked) {
    // ... try to send SMS ...
}
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
// Send reminders first
let sentCount = 0;
for (const recipient of recipients) {
    try {
        await sendDeloadingReminder(booking, recipient);
        sentCount++;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to send deloading reminder to ${recipient.fields['Name']}:`, error);
    }
}

// Only mark as sent if at least one SMS was successfully sent
if (sentCount > 0) {
    await markReminderSent(booking.id, 'deloading');
    console.log(`✅ Marked deloading reminder as sent after sending ${sentCount} SMS messages`);
} else {
    console.log(`⚠️ No deloading reminders sent - will retry next cycle`);
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Reliability**: Reminders only marked as sent after successful SMS delivery
2. **Retry Logic**: Failed attempts will be retried on the next scheduler cycle (1 minute)
3. **Error Handling**: Individual SMS failures don't prevent other recipients from receiving
4. **Logging**: Better visibility into what happened with each reminder attempt

## Files Modified
- `api/booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed.js` - Updated both onboarding and deloading reminder logic

## Testing
Created test script `test-reminder-fix.js` to verify the fix.

## Deployment
Deploying to production Railway environment.
