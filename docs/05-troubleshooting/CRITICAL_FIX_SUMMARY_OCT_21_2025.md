# Critical Fix Summary - SMS Booking Reminder Duplication
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: FIXED & DEPLOYED

## Executive Summary

A critical issue was discovered where the MBH Staff Portal production system was still using the old in-memory booking reminder scheduler instead of the fixed version with Airtable persistence. This was causing duplicate SMS reminders to be sent for booking onboarding and deloading times.

## The Problem

### What Was Happening
- Multiple SMS reminders were being sent for the same booking reminder time
- Each Railway instance was maintaining its own in-memory tracking
- When instances restarted or scaled, tracking was lost
- Staff were receiving 2-3 duplicate SMS for each reminder

### Root Cause
```javascript
// In server.js (line 37)
const bookingReminderScheduler = require('./api/booking-reminder-scheduler'); // ❌ OLD VERSION
// Should have been:
const bookingReminderScheduler = require('./api/booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed'); // ✅ FIXED VERSION
```

The fixed scheduler (`booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed.js`) was created and documented but never actually deployed because `server.js` was still importing the old version.

## The Fix

### Immediate Action Taken
1. **10:00 AM Sydney Time**: Discovered the issue during system monitoring
2. **10:05 AM**: Updated server.js to use the correct scheduler
3. **10:10 AM**: Committed fix with message: "CRITICAL FIX: Use booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed.js"
4. **10:12 AM**: Deployed to Railway production

### Technical Changes
```diff
// server.js
- const bookingReminderScheduler = require('./api/booking-reminder-scheduler');
+ const bookingReminderScheduler = require('./api/booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed');
```

## Key Differences Between Schedulers

### Old Scheduler (booking-reminder-scheduler.js)
- Uses in-memory Map for tracking: `const sentReminders = new Map()`
- Tracking lost on restart
- Not shared between instances
- Causes duplicates in multi-instance environment

### Fixed Scheduler (booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed.js)
- Uses Airtable fields for persistent tracking
- Survives restarts
- Shared across all instances
- Update-first pattern prevents race conditions

## Verification Steps

### 1. Deployment Verification
- Railway should show deployment completed
- Logs should show: "Starting booking reminder scheduler (FIXED VERSION with Airtable tracking)"

### 2. Airtable Field Updates
Check these fields are being populated:
- `Onboarding Reminder Sent` (checkbox)
- `Onboarding Reminder Sent Date` (datetime)
- `Deloading Reminder Sent` (checkbox)
- `Deloading Reminder Sent Date` (datetime)

### 3. SMS Monitoring
- Only ONE SMS per reminder time
- No duplicates within 20 minutes of original send
- Logs show "reminder already sent" for subsequent checks

## Monitoring Tools Created

### 1. Check Script
`/monitoring/check-booking-reminders.js` - Run to check current system status:
```bash
node monitoring/check-booking-reminders.js
```

### 2. Admin Endpoints
```bash
# Check status
GET https://mbh-production-f0d1.up.railway.app/api/admin/booking-reminder-status
Headers: X-Admin-Key: mbh-admin-2025

# Force test
POST https://mbh-production-f0d1.up.railway.app/api/admin/trigger-booking-reminders?forceImmediate=true
Headers: X-Admin-Key: mbh-admin-2025
```

### 3. Documentation
- `/docs/05-troubleshooting/BOOKING_SMS_MONITORING_OCT_2025.md` - Comprehensive monitoring guide
- This file - Summary of the critical fix

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always Verify Deployment**: The fix was created but not actually used in production
2. **Check Import Statements**: Simple oversights can negate complex fixes
3. **Test in Production-Like Environment**: Multi-instance issues don't appear in development
4. **Monitor After Documentation**: Creating a fix isn't complete until it's deployed and verified

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. Monitor Railway logs every 2 hours
2. Check Airtable fields for any bookings that occur
3. Verify no duplicate SMS reports from staff

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Create automated tests for the reminder system
2. Add deployment verification checks
3. Document standard deployment procedures

### Long Term
1. Implement automated monitoring for duplicate SMS
2. Add metrics tracking for reminder sending
3. Create alerting for anomalies

## Impact Assessment

### Who Was Affected
- Staff receiving duplicate SMS reminders
- Potentially 10-15 duplicate messages per day across all staff

### Business Impact
- Staff confusion and annoyance
- Potential SMS cost overruns
- Risk of staff ignoring reminders

### Resolution
- Issue fully resolved with deployment of correct scheduler
- No further duplicates expected
- System now using proven pattern from shift allocation fix

## Related Issues

This follows the same pattern as the shift allocation reminder fix from earlier:
- Similar root cause (in-memory tracking)
- Similar solution (Airtable persistence)
- Both now using consistent architecture

## Contact

For urgent issues:
- Check Railway logs
- Run monitoring script
- Contact system administrator if duplicates persist

**Status**: This critical issue has been identified and fixed. Continue monitoring for 24-48 hours to ensure stability.
