# Railway Production Registry Workaround Guide

## Issue
Railway's production registry (production-us-west2.railway-registry.com) is failing with connection reset errors, preventing deployments.

## Workaround Steps

### 1. Create New Environment (Recommended)
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click environment dropdown → "+ New Environment"
3. Choose "Duplicate Environment" → Select "Development"
4. Name it "Production-New"
5. Deploy staged changes
6. Update your custom domain to point to this environment

### 2. Alternative: Use Development as Production
- Your development environment is already working
- Just point your production domain to development environment
- This is a valid long-term solution

### 3. Monitor Railway Status
- Check: https://status.railway.app/
- Registry issues at: 162.220.232.123:443
