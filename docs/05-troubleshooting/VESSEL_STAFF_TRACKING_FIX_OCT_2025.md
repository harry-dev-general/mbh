# Vessel Display and Staff Tracking Fix - October 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Vessel Information Showing as "N/A"
**Problem**: Despite bookings having vessel information, the checklists displayed "N/A" for vessel.

**Root Cause**: The code only checked `bookingData['Vessel']` field, but the Bookings Dashboard table stores vessel information in multiple possible fields:
- `Vessel` - Single line text field (might be empty)
- `Booked Boat Type` - Formula field that extracts boat type from booking items
- `Boat` - Linked record field to the Boats table

**Solution**: Updated vessel display logic to check all three fields in order:
```javascript
${bookingData['Vessel'] || bookingData['Booked Boat Type'] || (bookingData['Boat'] && bookingData['Boat'].length > 0 ? 'Boat Assigned' : 'N/A')}
```

### 2. Staff Member Not Being Tracked
**Problem**: When staff access checklists via SMS links, their identity was not captured.

**Root Cause**: 
- `const employee = null` meant no employee context was available
- The `submittedBy` parameter was hardcoded to 'Staff Member'
- No mechanism to capture staff information from SMS link users

**Solution**: Added required staff identification fields to both checklist forms:
- Staff Name (required text input)
- Staff Phone Number (required tel input)

Staff information is now:
1. Collected via form inputs
2. Included in the submission data
3. Appended to the Notes/Damage Report fields in Airtable

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. `/api/checklist-renderer.js`
   - Updated vessel display logic in both `renderPreDepartureChecklist` and `renderPostDepartureChecklist`
   - Added staff identification section to both checklist forms
   - Updated data collection in `handleSubmit` functions
   - Modified Airtable submission to include staff info in Notes fields

### UI Changes
- Added a highlighted yellow section at the top of each checklist for staff identification
- Made staff name and phone number required fields
- Styled with appropriate icons and consistent with existing design

### Data Storage
- Pre-Departure Checklist: Staff info appended to 'Notes' field
- Post-Departure Checklist: Staff info appended to 'Damage Report' field
- Format: "Completed by: [Name] ([Phone])"

## Testing Results

Vessel display now correctly shows:
1. Direct vessel name if available
2. Falls back to boat type from booking items
3. Shows "Boat Assigned" if linked boat record exists
4. Only shows "N/A" if no vessel information available

Staff tracking:
- Required fields ensure staff identification
- Information preserved in Airtable for audit trail
- Phone number enables follow-up if needed

## Next Steps

1. Monitor production deployment
2. Verify vessel information displays correctly for all booking types
3. Confirm staff information is being captured in Airtable
4. Consider future enhancement: Link staff phone numbers to Employee records for automatic identification

## Deployment Date
