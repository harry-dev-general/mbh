# Railway Support Ticket - Clarification Needed

## Issue Type: Docker Registry Infrastructure Failure
**NOT a PostgreSQL/Database Issue**

Dear Railway Support,

The automated FAQ articles provided are all about PostgreSQL "connection reset by peer" errors. My issue is completely different - it's a **Docker Registry push failure**.

## Specific Issue:
- **What fails**: Docker image push to `production-us-west2.railway-registry.com`
- **Error**: "connection reset by peer" during registry push (NOT database connection)
- **When it happens**: After successful build, during "importing to docker" phase
- **Registry IP**: 162.220.232.123:443
- **Duration**: 3+ days now

## Build Timeline:
```
05:04:27 - Build starts
05:05:13 - Build completes successfully (46 seconds)
05:05:25 - Auth to production-us-west2.railway-registry.com
05:05:27 - Hangs indefinitely (connection reset)
```

## What We've Tried:
1. ✗ Different branches (main, development)
2. ✗ Custom Dockerfile
3. ✗ Repository cleanup (now only 29MB)
4. ✗ New Railway environment (same registry, same failure)
5. ✗ All environments in project fail identically

## Critical Details:
- Project ID: 4f5a2937-91c1-4754-a858-0f03f6b8af2f
- ALL environments route to same broken registry
- Development environment was working until we tried production
- Build phase works perfectly (Nixpacks or Dockerfile)
- Failure is ONLY during registry push

## Not Related To:
- ❌ PostgreSQL connections
- ❌ SSL certificates
- ❌ Database pooling
- ❌ Environment variables
- ❌ Alpine vs Slim images

## Required Action:
Please escalate to infrastructure team. The Docker registry service at `production-us-west2.railway-registry.com` is dropping connections for our project.

This is blocking all deployments and is business critical.

Thank you!
