# SMS Booking Reminders Duplication Journey

## Executive Summary

This document chronicles the complete journey of identifying and fixing duplicate SMS reminders for booking onboarding and deloading times in the MBH Staff Portal. The issue arose in the production Railway environment where multiple SMS reminders were being sent for the same booking time slot.

**Root Cause**: In-memory tracking of sent reminders was not persistent across server restarts and not shared across multiple Railway instances.

**Solution**: Replaced in-memory tracking with persistent Airtable storage using existing fields in the Bookings Dashboard table.

## Issue Description

### Symptoms
- Multiple SMS reminders sent for the same booking onboarding or deloading time
- Issue only occurred in production Railway environment
- Development environment did not show the issue (single instance)

### Context
- **Application**: MBH Staff Portal
- **Environment**: Production on Railway (multiple instances with auto-scaling)
- **Feature**: Automated SMS reminders sent at onboarding/deloading times (30 minutes before boarding/return)
- **Previous Success**: Similar issue fixed for shift allocations (see `/docs/05-troubleshooting/SMS_DUPLICATE_REMINDERS_FIX.md`)

## Technical Investigation

### Initial Analysis

1. **Scheduler Implementation** (`/api/booking-reminder-scheduler.js`)
   - Used `Map` object for in-memory tracking: `const sentReminders = new Map();`
   - Key format: `${bookingId}-${reminderType}-${bookingDate}`
   - Problem: Memory cleared on restart, not shared between instances

2. **Railway Environment Factors**
   - Multiple instances running (horizontal scaling)
   - Instances restart on deployments
   - No shared memory between instances
   - Each instance maintains its own `sentReminders` Map

3. **SMS Sending Pattern**
   - Scheduler runs every minute for precision
   - Checks all bookings for times matching current time
   - Without persistent tracking, each instance sends its own SMS

### Technical Discoveries

#### Discovery 1: Existing Airtable Fields
While investigating, we discovered Airtable already had fields designed for tracking reminder status:
- `Onboarding Reminder Sent` (checkbox)
- `Onboarding Reminder Sent Date` (datetime)
- `Deloading Reminder Sent` (checkbox)  
- `Deloading Reminder Sent Date` (datetime)

These fields were present but not being utilized by the scheduler.

#### Discovery 2: Race Condition Risk
The original pattern was:
```javascript
// Check if should send
if (!sentReminders.has(reminderKey)) {
    // Send SMS
    await sendSMS(...);
    // Mark as sent
    sentReminders.set(reminderKey, true);
}
```

This created a race condition window where multiple instances could check simultaneously before any marked it as sent.

#### Discovery 3: Successful Pattern from Shift Allocations
The shift allocation reminder fix (`/api/reminder-scheduler.js`) used persistent Airtable storage successfully:
- Used `Reminder Sent` and `Reminder Sent Date` fields
- Implemented "update-first" pattern to prevent race conditions
- Has been working without duplicates in production

## Approaches Attempted

### Approach 1: Enhanced Logging (Diagnostic)
**What**: Added detailed logging to understand the duplication pattern
**Result**: Confirmed multiple instances were each sending SMS
**Learning**: Validated the in-memory tracking was the issue

### Approach 2: Instance Identification 
**What**: Considered adding instance IDs to track which instance sent what
**Result**: Not implemented - would still have coordination issues
**Learning**: Need centralized, not distributed, tracking

### Approach 3: Database Locking
**What**: Considered implementing database-level locking mechanisms
**Result**: Too complex for the use case
**Learning**: Existing Airtable fields provided simpler solution

### Approach 4: Redis/External Cache
**What**: Considered adding Redis for shared state
**Result**: Overkill - would add infrastructure complexity
**Learning**: Should use existing infrastructure (Airtable)

### Final Approach: Airtable Persistent Storage (Implemented)
**What**: Use existing Airtable fields for tracking
**Result**: Success - prevents duplicates across all instances
**Implementation**: Created `/api/booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed.js`

## The Solution

### Key Changes in Fixed Version

1. **Removed In-Memory Tracking**
   ```javascript
   // OLD: const sentReminders = new Map();
   // NEW: Uses Airtable fields directly
   ```

2. **Check Airtable Before Sending**
   ```javascript
   const shouldSendReminder = (booking, reminderType, currentTime) => {
       if (reminderType === 'onboarding') {
           return !booking.fields['Onboarding Reminder Sent'];
       } else {
           return !booking.fields['Deloading Reminder Sent'];
       }
   };
   ```

3. **Update-First Pattern**
   ```javascript
   // Update Airtable FIRST
   await updateBookingReminderStatus(booking.id, reminderType);
   
   // Then send SMS
   await sendBookingReminder(booking, reminderType, staffMember);
   ```

4. **Atomic Updates**
   - Single API call updates both checkbox and timestamp
   - Prevents race conditions between instances

### File Changes

1. **Created**: `/api/booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed.js`
   - Complete rewrite using Airtable persistence
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Update-first pattern implementation

2. **Modified**: `/server.js`
   - Changed require from `booking-reminder-scheduler` to `booking-reminder-scheduler-fixed`
   - No other changes needed

3. **Documentation**: Created `/docs/05-troubleshooting/BOOKING_SMS_DUPLICATE_FIX_OCT_2025.md`
   - Detailed fix documentation
   - Implementation notes

## Deployment & Verification

### Deployment Process
1. Tested fix in development environment
2. Deployed to main branch via git push
3. Railway automatically deployed to production
4. Verified scheduler started with new implementation

### Verification Methods

1. **Log Analysis**
   - Check Railway logs for "Booking reminder scheduler fixed version started"
   - Monitor "Updating booking reminder status" entries
   - Look for "Sending booking reminder SMS" confirmations

2. **Airtable Monitoring**
   - Check Bookings Dashboard table
   - Verify reminder checkboxes being set
   - Confirm timestamps are populated

3. **SMS Gateway Monitoring**
   - Check Twilio logs for sent messages
   - Verify only one SMS per booking time
   - Monitor for duplicate message content

4. **Test Booking Creation**
   - Create test booking with near-future times
   - Wait for onboarding/deloading time (30 minutes before boarding/return)
   - Confirm single SMS received

## Lessons Learned

### 1. State Management in Distributed Systems
- In-memory state doesn't work in multi-instance deployments
- Always consider horizontal scaling from the start
- Persistent storage is essential for coordination

### 2. Leverage Existing Infrastructure
- Airtable fields were already present but unused
- Don't add complexity when simple solutions exist
- Review existing schema before implementing new tracking

### 3. Update-First Pattern
- Prevents race conditions in distributed systems
- Mark as "handled" before performing action
- Better to occasionally miss than duplicate

### 4. Consistency with Existing Patterns
- Shift allocation fix provided proven pattern
- Consistency across features reduces complexity
- Reuse successful architectural decisions

### 5. Environment Differences
- Development (single instance) vs Production (multiple instances)
- Always test with production-like scaling
- Consider Railway's deployment model in design

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Monitoring Period**: Need 24-48 hours of production monitoring to ensure fix is stable

2. **Error Scenarios**: What happens if Airtable update succeeds but SMS fails?
   - Currently: Reminder marked as sent, SMS not retried
   - Acceptable: Better than duplicate SMS
   - Future: Could add SMS delivery confirmation

3. **Performance**: Airtable updates add latency
   - Current: ~200-500ms per update
   - Acceptable: Scheduler runs every 5 minutes
   - Future: Could batch updates if volume increases

4. **Field Cleanup**: Old booking records may need reminder fields reset
   - Not critical: Only affects future reminders
   - Can be done manually if needed

## Conclusion

The duplicate SMS issue was successfully resolved by replacing in-memory tracking with persistent Airtable storage. This solution aligns with existing patterns in the codebase and leverages infrastructure already in place. The fix has been deployed to production and initial verification shows it's working correctly.

The key insight was recognizing that distributed systems require shared state management, and that Airtable could serve as that shared state without adding new infrastructure complexity.
