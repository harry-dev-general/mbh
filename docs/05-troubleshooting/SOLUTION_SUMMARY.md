# MBH Staff Portal - Authentication Issue RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
The MBH Staff Portal was completely inaccessible on Railway deployment, showing 502 Bad Gateway errors. This prevented all authentication attempts and made it appear that Supabase was hanging.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Server Binding Issue** (PRIMARY CAUSE)
- **Problem**: Server was not explicitly binding to `0.0.0.0`
- **Impact**: Railway's edge proxy couldn't connect to the application
- **Fix**: Updated server to bind to `HOST = '0.0.0.0'`

### 2. **Static File URL Confusion**
- **Problem**: Files in `/training` directory are served at root level
- **Impact**: Trying to access `/training/index-fixed.html` returns 502
- **Correct URL**: `/index-fixed.html` (not `/training/index-fixed.html`)

### 3. **CSP Blocking**
- **Problem**: Content Security Policy was blocking new test pages
- **Fix**: Added test pages to CSP exclusion list

## Working URLs After Fix

### API Endpoints
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/api/test
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/api/config

### Test Pages (Note: NO /training prefix)
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/simple-test.html
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/index-fixed.html
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/supabase-direct-test.html
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/index-bypass.html
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/auth-no-check.html

### Original Pages
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/ (serves index.html)
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/auth.html
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/dashboard.html
- ✅ https://mbh-development.up.railway.app/management-dashboard.html

## Environment Variables Confirmed
All required environment variables are properly set in Railway:
- ✅ SUPABASE_URL
- ✅ SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- ✅ SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- ✅ AIRTABLE_API_KEY
- ✅ AIRTABLE_BASE_ID
- ✅ APP_URL
- ✅ NODE_ENV=production
- ✅ RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=development

## Next Steps
1. Test authentication flow with the fixed deployment
2. Verify Supabase `getSession()` no longer hangs
3. Check if role-based access control works properly

## Key Learnings
1. Always bind to `0.0.0.0` for Railway deployments
2. Static files served via `express.static` are at root level, not subdirectory
3. 502 errors mask the real issues - API endpoints are the best diagnostic tool
4. CSP can block pages silently - always check exclusion list
