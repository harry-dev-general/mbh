# Boat Type Field Implementation Complete

**Date**: September 4, 2025

## Summary

The boat type filtering feature has been fully implemented and is now using the "Booked Boat Type" formula field directly from Airtable.

## Implementation Details

### Previous State
- Code was parsing boat types from the "Booking Items" field client-side
- Required string matching logic to determine boat type
- Added console logs for debugging

### Current State
- Directly reads from the "Booked Boat Type" formula field in Airtable
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- No client-side parsing needed
- Removed debugging console logs

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```javascript
// Parse boat type from Booking Items field
const bookingItems = (booking['Booking Items'] || '').toLowerCase();
let bookedBoatType = 'Not specified';

if (bookingItems.includes('12person')) {
    bookedBoatType = '12 Person BBQ Boat';
} else if (bookingItems.includes('8person')) {
    bookedBoatType = '8 Person BBQ Boat';
} else if (bookingItems.includes('4person')) {
    bookedBoatType = '4 Person Polycraft';
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Get booked boat type from Airtable field
const bookedBoatType = booking['Booked Boat Type'] || 'Not specified';
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: All systems see the same boat type value
2. **Better Performance**: No client-side string parsing
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Logic centralized in Airtable
4. **Improved Reporting**: Can use boat type for grouping/filtering in Airtable views

## Verified Working

Tested with sample bookings:
- ✅ "12 Person BBQ Boat" properly populated
- ✅ Boat dropdown filters correctly
- ✅ Calendar and sidebar displays show boat types
- ✅ Modal summary shows correct boat type

## Live Features

1. **Calendar Blocks**: Shows boat type with ⚓ icon
2. **Sidebar List**: Displays boat type badges
3. **Allocation Modal**: 
   - Shows boat type in booking summary
   - Filters boat dropdown to matching vessels only
   - Info message shows which boat type is being filtered

The feature is now fully operational and using the proper Airtable field structure!
