# Boat Type Filtering Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented boat type filtering using the Airtable formula field "Booked Boat Type".

## Changes Made

### 1. Visual Enhancements

#### Calendar View
- Added boat type display with anchor icon
- Shows booked boat type (e.g., "12 Person BBQ Boat") in blue
- Included in hover tooltip for quick reference

#### Booking List
- Added boat type badge next to staff badges
- Blue badge with anchor icon shows the booked boat type
- Maintains existing boat assignment badge

### 2. Boat Selection Filtering

#### Modal Enhancements
When opening a booking allocation:
- Automatically detects booked boat type from formula field
- Filters boat dropdown to show only matching vessels
- Displays info message: "Customer booked: [type] - showing matching vessels only"
- Falls back to showing all boats if no type detected

#### Filter Logic
```javascript
// Filter boats by type
const filteredBoats = boatsData.filter(boat => 
    boat.fields['Boat Type'] === bookedBoatType
);
```

### 3. User Experience

#### Information Display
- Boat type visible at a glance in calendar blocks
- Clear indication of what customer booked
- Reduced chance of wrong boat assignments

#### Smart Filtering
- 12 Person BBQ Boat bookings → Only show Pumice Stone, Junior
- 8 Person BBQ Boat bookings → Only show Sandstone
- 4 Person Polycraft bookings → Only show Polycraft Yam, Polycraft Merc
