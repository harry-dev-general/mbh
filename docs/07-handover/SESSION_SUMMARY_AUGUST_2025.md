# MBH Staff Portal - Session Summary (August 20, 2025)

## üéØ Session Objectives Achieved

### Primary Goal: Staff Allocation System
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Built complete hourly staff allocation system with management dashboard and personal schedules

## üìã What Was Accomplished

### 1. Initial Setup & Verification
- ‚úÖ Verified Shift Allocations table structure (ID: `tbl22YKtQXZtDFtEX`)
- ‚úÖ Updated table IDs in both management and staff pages
- ‚úÖ Fixed deployment to correct repository (`harry-dev-general/mbh`)

### 2. Access Control & Navigation
- ‚úÖ Updated redirect logic: Landing page ‚Üí Dashboard (not training)
- ‚úÖ Added management emails: harry@priceoffice.com.au, mmckelvey03@gmail.com
- ‚úÖ Fixed navigation flow throughout the portal

### 3. Major Technical Challenges Solved

#### Challenge A: Staff Availability Not Showing
**Timeline of fixes**:
1. Corrected Roster table ID (was using wrong ID)
2. Fixed year context (system operates in 2025, not 2024)
3. Resolved timezone issues with `formatLocalDate()` function
4. Fixed filtering for mixed data formats (Week Starting vs Date fields)

#### Challenge B: Allocations Not Rendering
**Solutions implemented**:
1. Built visual rendering system for calendar grid
2. Calculated dynamic heights based on duration
3. Added duplicate submission prevention
4. Fixed Airtable field value mismatches (422 errors)

#### Challenge C: Test Staff Allocations Invisible
**Root cause**: Airtable filterByFormula doesn't work with linked arrays
**Final solution**: Client-side filtering
```javascript
// Fetch all, filter locally
const filtered = allRecords.filter(r => 
    r.fields['Employee']?.includes(employeeId)
);
```

### 4. Feature Enhancements

#### Booking Integration on Calendar
- ‚úÖ Display bookings from Bookings Dashboard
- ‚úÖ Color coding: Green (fully staffed) / Red (needs staff)
- ‚úÖ Click-to-allocate functionality
- ‚úÖ Pre-filled allocation form for booking roles

#### Visual Improvements
- ‚úÖ Added dates (DD/MM) under weekday headers
- ‚úÖ Current day highlighting with blue outline
- ‚úÖ Accurate time display (7h 47min vs just 7h)

## üîß Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Client-Side Filtering Strategy
**Decision**: Abandon complex Airtable formulas, filter in browser
**Rationale**: Airtable's limitations with linked records
**Impact**: Works reliably but fetches more data

### 2. Date Context Hardcoding
**Decision**: Force all dates to 2025
**Rationale**: System data is in 2025, avoid confusion
**Implementation**: 
```javascript
let today = new Date();
today.setFullYear(2025);
```

### 3. Precise Time Tracking
**Decision**: Show exact minutes, not rounded hours
**Rationale**: Critical for accurate payroll
**Result**: "7h 47min" display format

## üìä Data Created During Session

### Allocations Created
1. **Bronte**: Multiple test allocations (Aug 22-23, 2025)
2. **Test Staff**: 1 allocation (Aug 21, 2025, 9:00-16:47)

### Configuration Updates
- Management emails added to dashboard
- Table IDs verified and updated
- Debug logging added (can be removed)
