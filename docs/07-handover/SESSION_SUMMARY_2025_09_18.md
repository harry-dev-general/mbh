# Session Summary - September 18, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes implemented during the development session on September 18, 2025, focusing on Daily Run Sheet enhancements and Management Dashboard improvements.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Daily Run Sheet - Current Time Indicator
**Documentation**: `/docs/02-features/daily-run-sheet/CURRENT_TIME_INDICATOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

- Added dynamic red vertical line showing current time on timeline
- Updates every minute automatically
- Shows time label at top of indicator
- Only visible during operational hours (6 AM - 8 PM)
- Respects Sydney timezone and 2025 date context

### 2. Daily Run Sheet - UI Improvements
**Documentation**: `/docs/02-features/daily-run-sheet/UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md`

- Fixed "Jump to" button styling to match red/white theme
- Enhanced hover effects and transitions
- Improved empty state messaging

### 3. Daily Run Sheet - Clickable Booking Allocations
**Documentation**: `/docs/02-features/daily-run-sheet/BOOKING_ALLOCATION_MODAL.md`

- Made allocation blocks clickable to show booking details
- Modal displays customer info, times, staff, and add-ons
- Multiple close methods (X button, overlay, Escape key)
- Add-ons shown with icons and prices

### 4. Management Dashboard - Dynamic Today's Overview
**Documentation**: `/docs/02-features/dashboard-overview/DYNAMIC_OVERVIEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

Replaced static placeholder values with real-time data:
- **Today's Bookings**: Actual count from Airtable
- **Staff on Duty**: Combined from shift allocations and bookings
- **Vessels Active**: Based on pre/post-departure checklists
- **Pending Issues**: Non-operational vessels count

### 5. Dashboard Overview - Bug Fixes
**Documentation**: 
- `/docs/02-features/dashboard-overview/ZEROS_ISSUE_INVESTIGATION.md`
- `/docs/02-features/dashboard-overview/PORTAL_RESPONSE_BUG.md`

Fixed multiple issues causing zeros in dashboard:
- Corrected Allocations table ID (was using wrong ID)
- Added acceptance status filtering
- Fixed Portal response bug (missing Response Status field)
- Added comprehensive debug logging

## API Changes

### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/dashboard-overview` - Consolidated dashboard statistics

### New Modules
- `/api/dashboard-overview.js` - Handles all dashboard data fetching

### Modified Logic
- Staff counting now considers acceptance status
- Portal responses handled even without Response Status field
- Date context explicitly set to 2025

## Database Considerations

### Discovered Issues
1. **Portal Response Bug**: When staff respond via Portal, Response Status field is not set
2. **Table ID Mismatch**: Allocations table had wrong ID in API

### Fields Added to Queries
- Response Status
- Response Date  
- Response Method
- Onboarding Response
- Deloading Response

## Deployment Status
All changes have been successfully deployed to production via Railway.

## Known Issues / Future Work

1. **Portal Handler Fix Needed**: Should properly set Response Status field
2. **Current Workaround**: Assumes all Portal responses are acceptances
3. **Potential Enhancement**: Auto-refresh dashboard statistics
4. **Timeline Enhancement**: Add pulsing animation to current time indicator

## Testing Notes
- Tested with September 18, 2025 date context
- Verified Bronte's shift allocation issue (Portal response bug)
- Confirmed all UI elements match design theme
- Validated real-time data updates

## Performance Improvements
- Single API call for dashboard overview (previously multiple)
- Parallel data fetching in dashboard-overview module
- Efficient caching for vessel statuses

## Security Enhancements
- API keys remain server-side only
- No sensitive data exposed to frontend
- Proper error handling with fallbacks
