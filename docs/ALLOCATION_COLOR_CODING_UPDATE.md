# Allocation Color Coding Update - September 8, 2025

## Change Summary
Modified the booking allocation color coding system to show green when an individual allocation (onboarding OR deloading) has both staff AND boat assigned, rather than requiring both allocations to be staffed.

## Previous Behavior
- **Green**: Only when BOTH onboarding AND deloading had staff assigned
- **Red**: Any allocation missing staff
- Boat assignment was not considered in color coding

## New Behavior
- **Green**: When an individual allocation has BOTH:
  - ✅ Staff assigned
  - ✅ Boat assigned
- **Red**: When missing either staff OR boat
- Each allocation (onboarding/deloading) is evaluated independently

## Visual Changes

### Color Logic
```javascript
// Check if this specific allocation is complete (has both staff AND boat)
const isAllocationComplete = hasStaff && hasBoat;

// Style based on allocation completion status
const baseColor = isAllocationComplete ? '#4caf50' : '#f44336'; // Green if complete, red if not
```

### Opacity Levels
- **1.0**: Fully complete (staff + boat)
- **0.85**: Partially complete (missing either staff OR boat)
- **0.7**: Empty (missing both staff AND boat)

### Display Updates
Each allocation block now shows:
- Staff status icon: ✓ (assigned) or ✗ (not assigned)
- Boat status icon: ⚓ (assigned) or ✗ (not assigned)
- Example: `9:00 AM Staff:✓ Boat:⚓`

### Tooltip Information
Hovering over an allocation shows:
- Staff status (Assigned/NEEDED)
- Boat status (boat name or NEEDED)
- Overall status:
  - "COMPLETE ✅" - Both staff and boat assigned
  - "Needs Boat" - Staff assigned, boat missing
  - "Needs Staff" - Boat assigned, staff missing
  - "Needs Staff & Boat" - Both missing

### Legend Update
- **Green block**: "Complete Allocation (Staff + Boat)"
- **Red block**: "Incomplete (Missing Staff/Boat)"

## Benefits
1. **Clearer Status**: Immediately see what's missing for each allocation
2. **Independent Tracking**: Onboarding can be complete while deloading is still pending
3. **Better Resource Management**: Easily identify bookings that need boats assigned
4. **Improved Workflow**: Staff can focus on completing individual allocations

## Testing
1. Assign only staff to an allocation → Red block with "Needs Boat"
2. Assign only boat to an allocation → Red block with "Needs Staff"
3. Assign both staff and boat → Green block with "COMPLETE ✅"
4. Each allocation (onboarding/deloading) works independently

## Technical Details
- Uses existing `hasStaff` parameter for staff status
- Adds new `hasBoat` check using `booking['Boat']`
- Combines both checks for `isAllocationComplete`
- No database changes required

## Deployment
Changes deployed in commit `83175b4` on September 8, 2025.
