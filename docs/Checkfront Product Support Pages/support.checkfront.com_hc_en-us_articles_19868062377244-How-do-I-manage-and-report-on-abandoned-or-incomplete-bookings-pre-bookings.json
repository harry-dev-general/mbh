The inventory is released if the booking is not completed before the hold time expires. The Customer has the option to extend the hold time when prompted.\n\nShould payment not be completed, the system considers the booking abandoned or incomplete and stays in the _Pre-booking_ status.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Note](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868062274460) | There is no option to adjust the default _Pre-Booking_ hold time. |\n\n* * *\n\n## Managing abandoned or incomplete bookings\n\n[Back to top](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/19868062377244-How-do-I-manage-and-report-on-abandoned-or-incomplete-bookings-pre-bookings# \"Back to top\")\n\n_Pre-bookings_ are held in the system for 30 days.  **Account Activity** report (Reports > Account Activity) entries showing the _Pre-booking_ event are permanent.\n\nThis gives you time to reconcile your reports and our Support team time to troubleshoot missing payments.\n\nWithin these 30 days, Staff can access _Pre-bookings_ to change their status or add payment as needed.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Note](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868062274460) | If your Ecommerce settings do not require payment to complete a booking, the booking status is automatically set to the default Customer Status in the **Configuration** area (Manage > Setup > Configuration).<br>Bookings created through the _[Checkfront](https://www.checkfront.com/)_ API bypass the _Pre-booking_ status and are set to the default Staff Status selected in the **Configuration** area (Manage > Setup > Configuration). |\n\n* * *\n\n## Abandoned or incomplete bookings from the Customer's perspective\n\n[Back to top](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/19868062377244-How-do-I-manage-and-report-on-abandoned-or-incomplete-bookings-pre-bookings# \"Back to top\")\n\n![Payment Page Back Button](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868062325788)\n\nWhile Customers do not see the internal _Pre-booking_, they can cancel a booking after arriving on the payment page (and before completing payment) by clicking the **Back** button.\n\n![Booking Page Clear](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868074259100)\n\nThey are returned to the booking page, where they can select **Clear** and then **Confirm?** to confirm the selection.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Note](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868062274460) | A _Pre-booking_ cleared by a Customer converts the booking's status from _Pre-booking_ to _Void_ in the system. |\n\n* * *\n\n## Reporting on abandoned or incomplete bookings\n\n[Back to top](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/19868062377244-How-do-I-manage-and-report-on-abandoned-or-incomplete-bookings-pre-bookings# \"Back to top\")\n\nThe following reporting tools allow you to filter results by the _Pre-booking_ status:\n\n- [Booking Calendar](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/articles/19868279247900)\n- [Booking Index](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/articles/19868166711068)\n- [Daily List](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/articles/19868194447132)\n- [Daily Manifest](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/articles/19868102802204)\n\nBy default, reports exclude _Pre-bookings_, but you can include them by selecting the option from the **Status** filter.\n\nYou can also view and export the [Account Activity](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/articles/19868268001692) report to view _Pre-booking_ entries _._\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Learn More](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868039253532) | Learn more about reporting here:<br>- [Getting Started with Reporting: FAQ](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/articles/19868215665948) |\n\n* * *\n\n## Notifications of abandoned or incomplete bookings\n\n[Back to top](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/19868062377244-How-do-I-manage-and-report-on-abandoned-or-incomplete-bookings-pre-bookings# \"Back to top\")\n\n![Pre-booking Scheduled Notification](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868073648284)\n\nYou can schedule and receive notifications for bookings that have been abandoned without payment, e.g. Schedule a notification to be sent 24 hours after pre-booking.
