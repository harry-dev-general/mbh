Adding links to email notifications using email variables is a good way to do this!\"_ _**\\- Jordan, Technical Support Lead**_ |\n\nWould you like to provide an easy way for Customers to pay for a booking directly from an email you send them? You can display the URL directly in the email or as a text link using email variables.\n\nThis is an excellent option if you don't require Customers to pay at the same time they book or want them to pay a remaining balance!\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![FAQ](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868076624924) | **What are email variables?**<br>Email variables are elements you can add to email messages that are automatically filled with information once received by the recipient. For example, you can add a payment link to bring Customers to your booking payment page.<br>There are two payment variables available:<br>- _{$BOOKING\\_PAYMENT\\_URL}_ links to the payment page for a booking. If no balance is due, this redirects to the receipt page.<br>  <br>- _{$BOOKING\\_PAY\\_FULL\\_URL}_ links to the payment page for a booking. This requests the full payment from the Customer even if a deposit is still owed. If no balance is due, this redirects to the receipt page. |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Note](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868076634268) | The notification payment link differs from the Pay Now Link option, which adds a button to the Booking Invoice for Customers to click and pay the remaining balance.<br>Find out more here:<br>- [Managing Booking Invoice layout options](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/articles/19868417230748) |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Attention](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868064559132) | Adding a payment link to a notification after you accept bookings does not update previously sent emails.
