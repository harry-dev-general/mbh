The options presented here depend on how you have configured your product under the **Availability** tab ( _All Day_, _Nightly_, _Timeslots_, or _Flextime_). The following table illustrates these options.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Availability** | **Per Booking** | **Per 24 Hours** | **Per Time Increment** | **Example** |\n| _All Day_ | ✓ | X | ✓ Per Day | All-day bike rentals at $50.00 per day. |\n| _Nightly_ | ✓ | X | ✓ Per Night | Room rentals at $100.00 per night. |\n| _Timeslots_ | X | X | ✓ Per timeslot/Per hour | Kayak rentals at $25.00 per hour. |\n| _Flextime: 10 minutes_ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ per 10 minutes | Zipline bookings are scheduled at 15-minute increments and are charged $75.00 per booking. |\n| _Flextime: 15 minutes_ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ per 15 minutes |\n| _Flextime: 20 minutes_ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ per 20 minutes |\n| _Flextime: 30 minutes_ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ per 30 minutes |\n| _Flextime: 1 Hour_ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ per Hour |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Example](https://support.checkfront.com/hc/article_attachments/19868064073244) | **Per Booking vs. Per Time Increment Example**<br>For example, if you configured a room rental with a base rate of $100.00 and a time increment of _Per Day_, a 5-day booking would be billed at $500.00.
