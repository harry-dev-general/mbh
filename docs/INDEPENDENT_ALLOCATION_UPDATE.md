# Independent Boat and Staff Allocation Update

## Overview
Updated the management allocations modal to allow managers to assign boats and staff independently for customer bookings. Previously, the system required both a staff member and role to be selected before allowing any updates to bookings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Required Validation
- Removed `required` attribute from the staff member dropdown
- Staff selection is now optional for booking allocations

### 2. Updated Visual Indicators
- Added "(Optional)" label to Staff Member field for booking allocations
- Changed boat assignment from required (*) to "(Optional)"
- Labels dynamically show/hide based on allocation type

### 3. Enhanced Form Logic
For **Booking Allocations** (Boat Hire / Ice Cream Boat):
- Staff assignment is optional
- Boat assignment is optional
- At least one must be selected (validated)
- Can update either or both independently

For **General Allocations**:
- Staff member remains required (creates shift record)
- No boat assignment option

### 4. Improved Success Messages
Dynamic messages based on what was updated:
- "Boat assigned to booking successfully!" (boat only)
- "Staff allocated to booking successfully!" (staff only)
- "Staff and boat assigned to booking successfully!" (both)
- "Booking updated successfully!" (general case)

### 5. Validation Logic
```javascript
// For booking allocations
if (Object.keys(updateFields).length === 0) {
    alert('Please select either a staff member or a boat to assign to this booking.');
    return;
}

// For general allocations
if (!employeeId) {
    alert('Please select a staff member for this allocation.');
    return;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Assign Only a Boat
1. Click on booking in calendar
2. Leave Staff Member as "Select Staff Member"
3. Select a boat from dropdown
4. Click "Create Allocation"

### Assign Only Staff
1. Click on booking in calendar
2. Select Staff Member and Role
3. Leave boat as "Select Boat"
4. Click "Create Allocation"

### Update Existing Assignment
1. Click on booking with existing assignments
2. Change only what needs updating
3. Submit to save changes

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Managers can assign resources as they become available
2. **Efficiency**: No need to make decisions about both staff and boats at once
3. **Clarity**: Visual indicators show what's optional vs required
4. **Progressive Updates**: Can assign boat first, then staff later (or vice versa)

## Technical Details

### Modified Functions
- `toggleBookingField()` - Shows/hides optional labels
- Form submission handler - Handles flexible field updates

### Validation Flow
