## Airtable Table Setup

### Create "Announcements" Table
1. In Airtable base (applkAFOn2qxtu7tx), create a new table called "Announcements"
2. Table ID will be: `tblAnnouncements` (update in code if different)

### Table Fields:

   - The announcement title
   - Required field

2. **Message** (Long text)
   - The full announcement message

   - Options: low (green), medium (yellow), high (red)
   - Default: low

4. **Posted By** (Single line text)
   - Email of the manager who posted
   - Automatically filled from current user

5. **Expiry Date** (Date)

6. **SMS Sent** (Checkbox)
   - Tracks if SMS was sent to staff
   - Set automatically by system

7. **Created Time** (Created time)
   - Auto-generated field

## Features Implemented

- **Auto-refresh**: Loads on page load

### SMS Notifications

## API Endpoints

## SMS Logic

2. Gets phone numbers from employee records
3. Sends SMS via Twilio to each staff member
4. Updates announcement record to mark SMS as sent

## Environment Variables Required
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token  
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+your_twilio_phone_number
