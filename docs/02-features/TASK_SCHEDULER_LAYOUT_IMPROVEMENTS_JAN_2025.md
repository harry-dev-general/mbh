# Task Scheduler Layout Improvements - January 2025

**Date**: January 16, 2025  
**Component**: /training/task-scheduler.html

## Overview

Based on user feedback showing truncated components, the Task Scheduler layout has been optimized to display more calendar content and ensure at least 3 tasks are visible in the tasks panel.

## Issues Addressed

From the screenshot provided:
1. Calendar was only showing a small time range (7am-11am)
2. Tasks panel was showing only 1 task
3. Overall components appeared too compressed

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Layout Height Adjustments

#### Main Layout
- **Before**: `height: calc(100vh - 200px)`
- **After**: `height: calc(100vh - 120px)`
- **Impact**: Added 80px more vertical space for all components

#### Tasks Container
- **Min Height**: Set to `250px` (ensures space for at least 3 tasks)
- **Max Height**: Changed from `calc(100vh - 500px)` to `calc(100vh - 400px)`
- **Impact**: 100px more space available for tasks display

#### Calendar Container
- **Min Height**: Increased from `600px` to `700px`
- **Calendar Element**: Added explicit `min-height: 600px`
- **Impact**: Guarantees more time slots visible

### 2. Calendar Time Slot Optimization

#### Slot Duration
- **Before**: 15-minute slots (`00:15:00`)
- **After**: 30-minute slots (`00:30:00`)
- **Benefit**: Shows more hours in the same vertical space
- **Note**: Retained 15-minute snap precision for dragging tasks

#### Visible Time Range
- With 30-minute slots and increased height, users can now see approximately:
  - **Before**: ~4 hours visible
  - **After**: ~8-10 hours visible

### 3. Sidebar Optimization

#### Panel Gap
- **Before**: `gap: 1.5rem` between panels
- **After**: `gap: 1rem`
- **Impact**: Saves 0.5rem (8px) between Tasks and Filter panels

#### Configuration Cleanup
- Removed duplicate `snapDuration` setting
- Maintained clean, efficient CSS structure

## Visual Improvements

### Tasks Panel
- ✅ Minimum 3 tasks always visible
- ✅ Smooth scrolling when more tasks exist
- ✅ Better use of vertical space

### Calendar View
- ✅ Shows 8-10 hours instead of 4
- ✅ Better overview of daily schedule
- ✅ Less scrolling needed to see full day
- ✅ 30-minute slots reduce visual clutter

## Technical Details

### Height Calculations
```css
/* Main container gets more of viewport */
height: calc(100vh - 120px);

/* Tasks can use more space */
max-height: calc(100vh - 400px);

/* Calendar guaranteed minimum space */
#calendar {
    flex: 1;
    min-height: 600px;
}
```

### Responsive Behavior
- Desktop: Dynamic heights based on viewport
- Mobile: Fixed heights maintained for consistency
- All changes preserve existing responsive breakpoints

## User Benefits

1. **Better Overview**: See more of your day without scrolling
2. **Task Visibility**: Always see multiple unassigned tasks
3. **Reduced Scrolling**: Less navigation needed
4. **Professional Layout**: Components properly sized for content
5. **Maintained Functionality**: All features work exactly as before

## Before vs After

### Before
- Calendar: ~4 hours visible (7am-11am)
- Tasks: 1 task visible
- Cramped appearance

### After
- Calendar: ~8-10 hours visible
- Tasks: 3+ tasks visible minimum
- Professional, spacious layout

## Future Considerations

1. **Dynamic Slot Duration**: User preference for 15/30/60 minute slots
2. **Collapsible Panels**: Option to hide Filter Tasks panel
3. **Resizable Panels**: Drag to resize sidebar width
4. **Zoom Controls**: Calendar zoom in/out buttons
5. **Compact Mode**: Toggle for users who prefer denser layouts
