# Task Scheduler Vertical Resource View Update

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Updated By**: Development Team

## Overview
The task scheduler has been updated from a horizontal timeline view to a vertical resource view using FullCalendar's `resourceTimeGrid` plugin.

## What Changed

### Previous Layout (Horizontal Timeline)
- **Y-axis**: Staff members
- **X-axis**: Days and time
- View type: `resourceTimelineWeek`

### New Layout (Vertical Resource View)
- **X-axis**: Days of the week
- **Y-axis**: Time slots (6am - 8pm)
- **Staff members**: Displayed as sub-columns under each day
- View type: `resourceTimeGridWeek`

## Key Benefits

1. **Better Daily Overview**: See all staff schedules for a specific time at a glance
2. **Improved Vertical Scrolling**: Natural scrolling through the day's timeline
3. **Clearer Time Slots**: Time is now on the familiar Y-axis
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All drag-drop and editing features remain intact

## Technical Details

### View Configuration
```javascript
initialView: 'resourceTimeGridWeek',
headerToolbar: {
    right: 'resourceTimeGridDay,resourceTimeGridWeek,dayGridMonth'
}
```

### New Settings
