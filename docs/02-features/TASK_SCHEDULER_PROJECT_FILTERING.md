# Task Scheduler Project Filtering Feature

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Updated By**: Development Team

## Overview
The task scheduler now includes project-based filtering, allowing managers to quickly sort and view tasks by their assigned projects.

## Changes Made

### 1. Title Update
- Changed "Unassigned Tasks" to "Tasks" to better reflect the panel's purpose
- The panel now serves as a comprehensive task viewer with filtering capabilities

### 2. Project Filter Dropdown
- Added below existing Priority and Status filters
- Dynamically populated from the Projects table in Airtable
- Options include:
  - **All Projects**: Shows all tasks regardless of project
  - **[Project Names]**: Individual projects from Airtable
  - **No Project**: Tasks without an assigned project

### 3. Visual Enhancements
- Project names displayed on task cards with a folder icon
- Project names shown in MBH blue color (#2E86AB)
- Clean, minimal design that doesn't clutter the task cards

## Technical Implementation

### Data Loading
```javascript
// Loads projects from Airtable
async function loadProjects() {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/airtable/${MANAGEMENT_BASE_ID}/${PROJECTS_TABLE_ID}`);
    // Creates projectMap for easy ID-to-name lookup
}
```

### Filtering Logic
- Works in conjunction with existing Priority and Status filters
- Filters applied cumulatively (AND logic)
- Special handling for "No Project" option

### Task Display
```javascript
// Shows project on task card if assigned
${projectName ? `<div class="task-project"><i class="fas fa-folder"></i> ${projectName}</div>` : ''}
```

## Usage

### To Filter by Project:
1. Select a project from the dropdown
2. Tasks instantly filter to show only those assigned to that project
3. Combine with Priority/Status filters for more specific results

### To Find Unassigned Tasks:
1. Select "No Project" from the dropdown
2. Shows all tasks without a project assignment
3. Useful for identifying tasks that need project allocation

## Benefits

1. **Quick Organization**: Instantly see all tasks for a specific project
2. **Better Planning**: Understand project workload at a glance
3. **Task Discovery**: Find tasks that haven't been assigned to projects
4. **Combined Filtering**: Use with other filters for precise task finding

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-select projects for viewing multiple projects at once
- Project color coding for visual differentiation
- Project task count badges
- Export filtered task lists by project
