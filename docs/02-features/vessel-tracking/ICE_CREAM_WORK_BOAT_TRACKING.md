# Ice Cream Boat and Work Boat Location Tracking

**Date**: September 17, 2025
**Feature**: Enable location tracking for Ice Cream Boat and Work Boat vessels

## Overview

Previously, the Ice Cream Boat and Work Boat vessels had fixed locations that couldn't be updated through the management dashboard. This has now been changed to allow full location tracking while still preserving their storage location information.

## Storage Locations

### Default Storage Locations
- **Ice Cream Boat**: Dalbora Marina The Spit, A Arm (-33.8058, 151.2485)
- **Work Boat**: Fergusons Marina (-33.8126, 151.2738)

## New Functionality

### 1. Location Update Button
- The "Update" button now appears for all vessels, including Ice Cream Boat and Work Boat
- Staff can update the current location of these vessels when they're moved

### 2. Storage Location Display
- When at storage location: Shows "Storage Location" with warehouse icon
- When moved: Shows current location with timestamp, and storage location as secondary info

### 3. Location Logic
- Fixed locations are now used as defaults only if no location data exists
- Once a location is updated, it preserves the user-updated location
- Storage location info is retained for reference

## User Interface Changes

### At Storage Location
```
üìç Dalbora Marina The Spit, A Arm
üè≠ Storage Location
[Map] [Update]
```

### At Different Location
```

üè≠ Storage: Dalbora Marina The Spit, A Arm
[Map] [Update]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes
1. Removed `isFixed` condition check for update button visibility
2. Modified fixed location logic to only apply when no location exists
3. Added storage location tracking when vessel is moved
4. Updated UI labels and icons for clarity

### Modified Logic
```javascript
// Set default location for fixed vessels if no location exists
if (fixedLocations[vessel.name]) {
    if (!vessel.currentStatus) {
        vessel.currentStatus = {};
    }
    // Only use fixed location if there's no existing location data
    if (!vessel.currentStatus.location || !vessel.currentStatus.location.latitude) {
        vessel.currentStatus.location = fixedLocations[vessel.name];
    } else {
        // Mark that this vessel has a storage location
        vessel.currentStatus.location.storageLocation = fixedLocations[vessel.name];
    }
}
```

### Benefits
- Full tracking capability for all vessels
- Clear distinction between storage and current location
- Preserves historical location data
- Better operational visibility

## Usage

1. **View Current Location**: Check vessel card on Staff Management tab
2. **Update Location**: Click "Update" button and set new location on map
3. **Return to Storage**: Update location back to storage coordinates when vessel returns

## Notes
- Storage locations remain as reference points
- Location updates create Post-Departure checklist records
- All location changes are timestamped for tracking
