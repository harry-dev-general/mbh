# Booking Status Values Summary

## Status Codes Found in Your System

Based on the duplicate cleanup scan, your booking system uses abbreviated status codes:

| Code | Meaning | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| PEND | Pending | Initial booking, awaiting payment |
| HOLD | Hold | Booking on hold (manual review needed?) |
| WAIT | Waiting | Similar to hold, possibly waiting for confirmation |
| PART | Partial Payment | Customer has made partial payment |
| PAID | Paid | Full payment received, booking confirmed |
| VOID | Void | Booking cancelled/voided |
| STOP | Stop | Booking stopped/cancelled |

## Duplicate Summary

Your scan found:
- **11 booking codes** with duplicates
- **15 total duplicate records** to clean up
- Most duplicates show status progression (e.g., PEND ‚Üí PAID)
- No staff assignments on any duplicates (good - no data to lose)

## Example Progressions

1. **Payment Success**: PEND ‚Üí PAID
2. **Payment with Hold**: PEND ‚Üí PART ‚Üí PAID
3. **Cancellation**: PEND ‚Üí VOID
4. **Complex**: PEND ‚Üí HOLD ‚Üí STOP

## Next Steps

### 1. Clean Up Existing Duplicates
Run the cleanup script with `dryRun = false`:
```javascript
// Change this line in the script:
let dryRun = false;
```

This will:
- Keep the oldest record (original)
- Update it to the latest status
- Delete the duplicates

### 2. Set Up Deduplication Automation
Create automation to prevent future duplicates:
- Trigger: Record created in Bookings Dashboard
- Action: Run deduplication script
- This will automatically merge duplicates going forward

### 3. Update SMS Notifications
The scripts have been updated to handle your status codes:
- **PEND ‚Üí PAID**: "Payment Confirmed" SMS
- **PEND ‚Üí PART**: "Partial Payment Received" SMS
- **Any ‚Üí VOID/STOP**: "Booking Cancelled" SMS
- **PEND ‚Üí HOLD/WAIT**: No SMS (minor change)
