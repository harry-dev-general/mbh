# Boat Type Filtering - Quick Reference

## What's New?

The management allocations page now shows what type of boat customers booked and filters boat selection accordingly.

## Visual Indicators

### Calendar View
- **âš“ 12 Person BBQ Boat** - Blue text showing booked boat type
- **ðŸš¢ Sandstone** - Assigned boat (if any)

### Booking List
- Blue badge with anchor icon shows boat type
- Separate badge shows assigned boat

## How It Works

1. **Customer books** "12personbbqboat-fullday"
2. **Airtable formula** extracts "12 Person BBQ Boat"
3. **Calendar shows** boat type visually
4. **When allocating**, only matching boats appear:
   - 12 Person â†’ Pumice Stone, Junior
   - 8 Person â†’ Sandstone
   - 4 Person â†’ Polycraft Yam, Polycraft Merc

## Manager Workflow

1. Click on any booking in the calendar
2. See info box: "Customer booked: 12 Person BBQ Boat"
3. Boat dropdown shows only matching vessels
4. Select and save - no wrong boat types!

## Testing

- Look for the **âš“ anchor icon** with boat type
- Open different booking types to see filtering
- Verify dropdown shows only relevant boats
