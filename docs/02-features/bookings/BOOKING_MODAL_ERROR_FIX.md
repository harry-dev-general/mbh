# Booking Allocation Modal Error Fix

**Date**: September 4, 2025

## Problem

After implementing the new booking allocation modal, clicking on customer booking slots resulted in an error:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: staffAvailability is not defined
    at management-allocations.html:2005:17
```

This prevented the modal from opening and managers couldn't allocate staff or boats to bookings.

## Root Cause

The `populateBookingStaffDropdown` function was trying to access a variable `staffAvailability` that:
1. Was defined locally within the `renderStaffList` function
2. Was not accessible in the global scope where `populateBookingStaffDropdown` was called

## Solution

Updated the `populateBookingStaffDropdown` function to:
1. Use the global `rosterData` variable directly
2. Follow the same pattern as the existing `populateStaffForDate` function
3. Extract staff availability information from roster records for the specific booking date

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```javascript
staffData.forEach(staff => {
    const staffId = staff.id;
    if (staffAvailability[staffId] && staffAvailability[staffId][dateKey]) {
        availableStaff.push(staff);
    }
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
rosterData.forEach(record => {
    const rosterDate = record.fields['Date'];
    const employeeId = record.fields['Employee']?.[0];
    const employeeName = record.fields['Employee Name'];
    
    if (rosterDate === bookingDate && employeeId) {
        // Check if we haven't already added this employee
        if (!availableStaff.some(s => s.id === employeeId)) {
            availableStaff.push({
                id: employeeId,
                name: employeeName
            });
        }
    }
});
```

## Testing

After the fix:
1. Booking allocation modal opens successfully
2. Staff dropdown shows only staff available on the booking date
3. Current staff assignments are displayed correctly
4. No console errors when clicking on booking slots

## Status

âœ… **Fixed and Deployed** - The error has been resolved and the fix is now live in production.
