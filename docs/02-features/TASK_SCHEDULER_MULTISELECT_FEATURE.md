# Task Scheduler Multi-Select Feature

**Date**: January 16, 2025  
**Component**: /training/task-scheduler.html

## Overview

A comprehensive multi-select feature has been implemented in the MBH Task Scheduler, allowing users to select multiple tasks and perform bulk operations efficiently.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Selection Mode Toggle

- **Toggle Button**: Added a checkbox icon button in the Tasks panel header
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl/Cmd + S` toggles selection mode
- **Visual Feedback**: Button highlights when active
- **Auto-Clear**: Selection clears when exiting selection mode

### 2. Task Selection UI

#### Checkboxes
- Checkboxes appear on all task cards when in selection mode
- Positioned at top-left of each task card
- Hidden by default, shown only in selection mode
- Task cards get extra padding to accommodate checkboxes

#### Visual Feedback
- Selected tasks have:
  - Light blue background (`#e8f4fd`)
  - Blue border (`#2E86AB`)
  - Subtle shadow effect
  - Checked checkbox

### 3. Selection Methods

#### Individual Selection
- Click checkbox to select/deselect individual tasks
- Checkbox clicks don't trigger drag operations

#### Range Selection (Shift+Click)
- Hold Shift and click another checkbox to select all tasks in between
- Works based on visual order in the task list
- Maintains the last clicked position for subsequent range selections

#### Select All
- Button in bulk operations bar
- Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Cmd + A` (when in selection mode)
- Selects all visible tasks (respecting current filters)

### 4. Bulk Operations Bar

A floating toolbar appears at the bottom of the screen when tasks are selected:

#### Components
- **Selected Count**: Shows "X tasks selected"
- **Clear Button**: Deselects all tasks
- **Select All Button**: Selects all visible tasks
- **Bulk Actions**:
  - Assign: Assign selected tasks to an employee
  - Change Status: Update status for all selected tasks
  - Delete: Remove selected tasks (with confirmation)

#### Behavior
- Slides up from bottom when tasks are selected
- Slides down when no tasks are selected
- Fixed position, centered horizontally
- Beautiful shadow and rounded corners

### 5. Bulk Operations

#### Bulk Assign
- Opens modal with employee dropdown
- Shows count of tasks being assigned
- Loading state during operation
- Success message after completion

#### Bulk Status Change
- Opens modal with status dropdown
- All standard task statuses available
- Loading state during operation
- Success message with new status

#### Bulk Delete
- Confirmation dialog shows task count
- Processes deletions in batches (Airtable limit: 10)
- Success message after completion
- Cannot be undone

### 6. Keyboard Shortcuts

New shortcuts added:
- `Ctrl/Cmd + S`: Toggle selection mode
- `Ctrl/Cmd + A`: Select all (in selection mode)
- `Escape`: Clear selection (when tasks selected)

Updated keyboard shortcuts modal includes new "Selection Mode" section.

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Global state variables
let isSelectionMode = false;        // Selection mode active
let selectedTaskIds = new Set();    // Selected task IDs
let lastSelectedTaskIndex = -1;     // For shift+click
```

### Batch Processing
- All bulk operations process in batches of 10 (Airtable API limit)
- Proper error handling with rollback messaging
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions

### Modal Handling
- Bulk operation modals properly lock body scroll
- Close handlers restore scroll behavior
- Consistent with existing modal patterns

### Performance
- Selection state persists during re-renders
- Efficient DOM updates using data attributes
- Debounced search maintains selection

## CSS Classes

### Selection Mode
- `.selection-mode`: Applied to sidebar container
- `.task-card.selected`: Selected task styling
- `.selection-toggle.active`: Active toggle button
- `.bulk-operations-bar.active`: Visible operations bar

## User Experience

### Entering Selection Mode
1. Click checkbox button in panel header
2. Or press `Ctrl/Cmd + S`
3. Checkboxes appear on all tasks
4. Bulk operations bar ready but hidden

### Selecting Tasks
1. Click individual checkboxes
2. Or Shift+Click for ranges
3. Or use Select All button/shortcut
4. Selected count updates in real-time

### Performing Bulk Operations
1. Select desired tasks
2. Click operation button in bulk bar
3. Configure operation in modal
4. Confirm action
5. See success message
6. Tasks refresh automatically

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test bulk operations on a few tasks first
2. **Use Filters**: Combine with existing filters for targeted operations
3. **Keyboard Efficiency**: Learn shortcuts for faster workflow
4. **Confirm Counts**: Always check selected count before operations
5. **Batch Wisely**: Large operations may take time

## Known Limitations

1. Maximum 10 tasks processed per API call (Airtable limit)
2. No undo for bulk delete operations
3. Selection doesn't persist across page refreshes
4. Calendar events not selectable (only unassigned tasks)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Calendar Integration**: Select tasks directly from calendar
2. **Smart Selection**: Select by criteria (priority, date range)
3. **Bulk Edit**: Edit multiple fields at once
4. **Selection Memory**: Persist selection in localStorage
5. **Undo System**: Track and reverse bulk operations
6. **Export Selected**: Download selected tasks as CSV
