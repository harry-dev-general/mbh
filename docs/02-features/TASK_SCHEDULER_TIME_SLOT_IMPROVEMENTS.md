# Task Scheduler Time Slot Display Improvements

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Updated By**: Development Team

## Issue
The time slots on the Y-axis of the calendar were extremely compressed, making it difficult to read times and schedule tasks effectively.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Slot Duration Changes
- Changed from 1-hour slots to 15-minute slots (4 slots per hour)
- Provides maximum granularity for precise task scheduling
- Time labels still shown every hour for clarity

### 2. Time Range Optimization
- Adjusted from 6am-8pm to 7am-7pm
- Reduces the number of time slots to display
- Better utilizes available vertical space

### 3. Height and Spacing Improvements
```javascript
// Calendar configuration
slotDuration: '00:15:00',           // 15-minute slots
slotLabelInterval: '01:00:00',      // Labels every hour
expandRows: true,                    // Fill available height
snapDuration: '00:15:00',           // Snap to 15-minute intervals
```

### 4. CSS Enhancements
- Minimum slot height of 25px for 15-minute slots
- Time axis width increased to 70px
- Visual hierarchy for time marks:
  - Solid lines for hour marks
  - Dashed lines for 30-minute marks
  - Dotted lines for 15 and 45-minute marks
- Improved container height calculation

### 5. Layout Optimizations
- Main layout height: `calc(100vh - 200px)`
- Calendar container min-height: 600px
- Mobile responsive: 70vh with 500px minimum

## Visual Improvements

### Time Display
```javascript
slotLabelFormat: {
    hour: 'numeric',
    minute: '2-digit',
    omitZeroMinute: true,
    meridiem: 'short'
}
```
Shows times as "8am", "9am", etc. for clean display

### Grid Lines
- Solid lines for hour marks
- Dashed lines for 30-minute marks
- Dotted lines for 15 and 45-minute marks
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Benefits
- **Better Readability**: Time slots are properly spaced
- **Maximum Precision**: 15-minute scheduling granularity
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes
- **Efficient Space Usage**: Maximizes calendar display area
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Easy to distinguish time intervals

## Technical Details
- `expandRows: true` ensures calendar fills available height
- `slotEventOverlap: false` prevents event overlap
- Flex layout with proper overflow handling
- Sticky positioning preserved for scrolling
