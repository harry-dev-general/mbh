## Overview

This document summarizes the removal of the Legend section and the "+ New Allocation" feature from the Weekly Schedule calendar component in the MBH Staff Portal.

## Changes Made

### 1. Legend Section Removal
- **Removed**: The entire legend container that showed color-coded allocation status indicators
- **Location**: Lines 1392-1409 removed from management-allocations.html
- **Impact**: Cleaner interface with more space for the calendar view

### 2. New Allocation Feature Removal

#### Button Removal
- **Removed**: "+ New Allocation" button from the date selector section
- **Location**: Lines 1414-1416 removed

#### Modal Removal
- **Removed**: Complete allocation modal dialog (id="allocationModal")
- **Location**: Lines 1461-1551 removed
- **Contents**: Form fields for creating/editing allocations including:
  - Allocation type selector
  - Employee selection
  - Date/time inputs
  - Booking selection
  - Role assignment
  - Boat assignment
  - Notes field

#### JavaScript Functions Removed
- `openAllocationModal()` - Function to open the allocation modal
- `closeAllocationModal()` - Function to close the allocation modal
- `openAllocationEditModal()` - Function to edit existing allocations
- `openShiftReassignmentModal()` - Function for reassigning shifts
- `deleteShiftAllocation()` - Function to delete allocations
- `handleCellClick()` - Function to handle calendar cell clicks for quick allocation
- `toggleBookingField()` - Function to toggle booking-specific fields
- Event handler for allocation form submission
- Event listeners for date changes in allocation modal

### 3. Calendar Updates
- **Date Click**: Disabled - clicking on empty calendar cells no longer opens allocation modal
- **Event Click**: Allocation editing removed - clicking on allocations no longer opens edit modal
- **Tooltips**: Updated to remove "Click to edit allocation times" text

### 4. Code Cleanup
- Removed all orphaned code related to the allocation system
- Cleaned up event handlers that referenced removed elements
- Removed references to non-existent functions
- Ensured proper file structure with no code after closing HTML tag

## Impact

### User Experience
- Simplified interface focused on viewing schedule information
- No ability to create or edit allocations directly from this interface
- Calendar is now read-only for allocation management

### Technical Impact
- Reduced code complexity
- Removed dependencies on allocation-related Airtable operations
- Improved page load performance by removing unused functionality

## Future Considerations

If allocation management needs to be re-implemented:
1. Consider a separate dedicated interface for allocation management
2. Implement role-based access control
3. Add bulk allocation features
4. Include conflict detection and resolution
