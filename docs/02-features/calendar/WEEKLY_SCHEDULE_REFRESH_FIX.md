# Weekly Schedule Refresh Fix

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Issue**: New allocations not appearing in Weekly Schedule after creation  
**Status**: Fixed  

## The Problem

When creating a new shift allocation:
1. SMS was sent successfully ‚úÖ
2. Success message was shown ‚úÖ
3. Record was created in Airtable ‚úÖ
4. But the allocation didn't appear in the Weekly Schedule ‚ùå

Console showed only 2 allocations when there should have been 3.

## Root Causes

### 1. Date Filter Issue
The original filter used `IS_AFTER` and `IS_BEFORE` which excluded boundary dates:
```javascript
// OLD - excluded Sunday if it was the last day of the week
`AND(IS_AFTER({Shift Date}, '${prevDayStr}'),IS_BEFORE({Shift Date}, '${nextDayStr}'))`

// NEW - includes all dates in the week
`AND(NOT({Shift Date} < '${startStr}'),NOT({Shift Date} > '${endStr}'))`
```

### 2. Caching Issues
Airtable API responses might have been cached, preventing fresh data from loading.

### 3. Timing Issues
The 1-second delay might not have been enough for Airtable to fully process the new record.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Date Filter
Changed to inclusive comparisons that properly include the start and end dates of the week.

### 2. Added Cache Busting
```javascript
headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${AIRTABLE_API_KEY}`,
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache'
}
```

### 3. Increased Processing Delay
Increased from 1 to 2 seconds to ensure Airtable has processed the record:
```javascript
setTimeout(async () => {
    // Reload allocations
}, 2000); // Was 1000
```

### 4. Force Data Refresh
Clear existing data before reloading:
```javascript
allocationsData = []; // Force fresh fetch
await loadAllocations();
```

### 5. Added Manual Refresh Button
Added a üîÑ Refresh button to the Weekly Schedule header for immediate updates.

### 6. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging of allocation dates to help debug issues:
```javascript
console.log('Allocation dates:', allocationsData.map(a => ({
    name: a.fields['Name'],
    date: a.fields['Shift Date'],
    employee: a.fields['Employee']?.[0]
})));
```

## Testing

1. Create a new allocation
2. Check console for:
   - "Reloading data after allocation creation..."
   - "Forcing calendar refresh with X allocations"
   - "Allocation dates:" showing all allocations

3. If allocation doesn't appear:
   - Click the üîÑ Refresh button
   - Check console for the allocation dates
   - Verify the date format matches YYYY-MM-DD

## Manual Refresh Function

If automatic refresh fails, users can click the refresh button which calls:
```javascript
window.manualRefreshSchedule()
```

This function:
1. Clears existing allocation data
2. Reloads from Airtable with no-cache headers
3. Forces calendar update
4. Logs the process for debugging

## Future Improvements

1. **WebSocket/Real-time Updates**: Use Airtable webhooks for instant updates
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Show allocation immediately, then sync with server
3. **Better Error Handling**: Show specific errors if refresh fails
4. **Loading State**: Show spinner during refresh
5. **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry if initial refresh fails
