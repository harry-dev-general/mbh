# Weekly Schedule Refresh Fix

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Issue**: New allocations not appearing in Weekly Schedule after creation  
**Status**: Fixed  
**Key Finding**: Production uses client-side filtering, not Airtable's filterByFormula

## The Problem

When creating a new shift allocation:
1. SMS was sent successfully ‚úÖ
2. Success message was shown ‚úÖ
3. Record was created in Airtable ‚úÖ
4. But the allocation didn't appear in the Weekly Schedule ‚ùå

Console showed only 2 allocations when there should have been 3.

## Root Causes

### 1. Airtable filterByFormula Date Issues
Airtable's filterByFormula has known reliability issues with date fields. The production system switched to client-side filtering for this reason.

**Development was using**:
```javascript
// Problematic server-side date filtering
`AND(NOT({Shift Date} < '${startStr}'),NOT({Shift Date} > '${endStr}'))`
```

**Production approach (now implemented)**:
```javascript
// Fetch all allocations
const allAllocations = data.records || [];

// Filter client-side
allocationsData = allAllocations.filter(record => {
    const shiftDate = record.fields['Shift Date'];
    const isInRange = dateStr >= weekStartStr && dateStr <= weekEndStr;
    return isInRange;
});
```

### 2. Caching Issues
Airtable API responses might have been cached, preventing fresh data from loading.

### 3. Timing Issues
The 1-second delay might not have been enough for Airtable to fully process the new record.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Switched to Client-Side Filtering (Final Fix)
Matched the production approach by fetching all allocations and filtering client-side. This avoids Airtable's unreliable filterByFormula date handling.

### 2. Cache Busting via Timestamp
Added timestamp parameter to URL instead of headers due to CORS restrictions:
```javascript
`&_t=${Date.now()}`
```
**Note**: Don't use `Cache-Control` or `Pragma` headers with Airtable API - they cause CORS errors!

### 3. Increased Processing Delay
Increased from 1 to 2 seconds to ensure Airtable has processed the record:
```javascript
setTimeout(async () => {
    // Reload allocations
}, 2000); // Was 1000
```

### 4. Force Data Refresh
Clear existing data before reloading:
```javascript
allocationsData = []; // Force fresh fetch
await loadAllocations();
```

### 5. Added Manual Refresh Button
Added a üîÑ Refresh button to the Weekly Schedule header for immediate updates.

### 6. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging of allocation dates to help debug issues:
```javascript
console.log('Allocation dates:', allocationsData.map(a => ({
    name: a.fields['Name'],
    date: a.fields['Shift Date'],
    employee: a.fields['Employee']?.[0]
})));
```

## Testing

1. Create a new allocation
2. Check console for:
   - "Reloading data after allocation creation..."
   - "Forcing calendar refresh with X allocations"
   - "Allocation dates:" showing all allocations

3. If allocation doesn't appear:
   - Click the üîÑ Refresh button
   - Check console for the allocation dates
   - Verify the date format matches YYYY-MM-DD

## Manual Refresh Function

If automatic refresh fails, users can click the refresh button which calls:
```javascript
window.manualRefreshSchedule()
```

This function:
1. Clears existing allocation data
2. Reloads from Airtable with no-cache headers
3. Forces calendar update
4. Logs the process for debugging

## Common Pitfalls

### CORS Headers with Airtable API
**Problem**: Adding cache-control headers causes CORS errors:
```
Request header field cache-control is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers
```

**Solution**: Use URL parameters for cache busting, not headers:
```javascript
// ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
headers: {
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache'
}

// ‚úÖ DO THIS INSTEAD
`?_t=${Date.now()}`
```

## Future Improvements

1. **WebSocket/Real-time Updates**: Use Airtable webhooks for instant updates
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Show allocation immediately, then sync with server
3. **Better Error Handling**: Show specific errors if refresh fails
4. **Loading State**: Show spinner during refresh
5. **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry if initial refresh fails
