# Weekly Schedule Date Issue Fix

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Issue**: Development branch showing September dates instead of current week  
**Resolution**: Merged main branch changes to fix hardcoded year issue  

## Problem Summary

The development branch's weekly schedule component was displaying September 21-27, 2025 instead of the current week (October 10, 2025). This occurred because the development branch was missing critical date handling fixes from the main branch.

## Root Cause

The main branch had a fix (commit c219af2) that removed hardcoded year 2025 for today's date highlighting. The specific issue was:

```javascript
// Before (problematic code):
const today = new Date();
today.setFullYear(2025);  // ❌ Hardcoded year
const todayStr = formatLocalDate(today);

// After (fixed code):
const today = new Date();  // ✅ Uses actual current date
const todayStr = formatLocalDate(today);
```

## Resolution Steps

1. **Identified Missing Commits**: The development branch was missing 43 commits from main, including the critical date fix.

2. **Merged Main into Development**: 
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git merge origin/main
   ```

3. **Resolved Conflicts**: 
   - Preserved FullCalendar implementation from development
   - Incorporated date fixes from main
   - Merged CSS styles appropriately

4. **Key Changes**:
   - Removed all hardcoded year references
   - Updated z-index for add-on indicators (10 → 15)
   - Preserved all FullCalendar functionality

## Verification

After the merge, the development branch now:
- Shows the correct current week (October 10, 2025)
- Includes all fixes from the main branch
- Maintains the FullCalendar implementation
- Has no date-related regressions

## Technical Details

### Merge Conflicts Resolved

1. **CSS Conflicts**: 
   - Kept FullCalendar styles from development
   - Updated z-index values from main
   - Preserved booking block positioning

2. **JavaScript Conflicts**:
   - Kept FullCalendar initialization from development
   - Removed hardcoded date references
   - Maintained event handling logic
