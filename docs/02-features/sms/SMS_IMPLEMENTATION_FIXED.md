# SMS Implementation Fixed - September 8, 2025

## Issue Resolved
SMS notifications were not being sent for booking staff allocations because the code was missing the API call to the notification service.

## What Was Fixed

### Previous State
- Comment incorrectly stated SMS was handled by Airtable automations
- No SMS notification call in booking allocation form submission
- SMS only worked for general allocations, not booking allocations

### Fixed Implementation
Added SMS notification call to the booking allocation form submission that:
1. Retrieves booking details (customer name, date, times)
2. Determines the role (Onboarding/Deloading)
3. Calls `/api/send-shift-notification` endpoint
4. Sends SMS via Twilio with magic accept/decline links

## SMS Message Format
Staff receive messages like:
```
üö§ MBH Staff Alert - New Onboarding Assignment

Hi Test Staff,

You've been assigned to a customer booking:

üìÖ Sat, 14 Sep
‚è∞ 8:30 AM - 9:00 AM
üë§ Customer: David Heibl
üìã Role: Onboarding

Please confirm your availability:

‚úÖ ACCEPT: [magic link]
‚ùå DECLINE: [magic link]

Reply by clicking a link above.
```

## Required Environment Variables
For SMS to work, these must be set on Railway:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+your_twilio_phone_number
```

## Testing
1. Allocate staff to a booking
2. Check console logs for "Sending SMS notification for booking allocation"
3. Verify SMS received at staff phone number
4. Test magic links for accept/decline functionality

## Important Notes
- SMS requires valid Twilio credentials in production
- Test Staff phone: +61424913757
- SMS failures don't block allocation (fail gracefully)
- Magic links expire after 72 hours
