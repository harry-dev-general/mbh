## Problem Statement

Staff members were receiving multiple SMS notifications for the same booking when:
- Managers updated add-ons without changing staff assignments
- Booking details were modified after initial assignment
- Any update was made to an already-accepted shift

This created confusion and SMS cost overruns.

## Root Cause

The original implementation sent SMS notifications on every booking update, regardless of whether the staff assignment had changed. The system did not track the previously assigned staff member, so it couldn't determine if a notification was necessary.

## Solution Implementation

### Logic Flow
1. Store current staff ID before updates
2. Compare with new staff ID after updates
3. Only send SMS if staff member has changed
4. Skip SMS for add-on-only updates

### Code Changes

#### Location: `/training/management-allocations.html`

```javascript
// Before form submission, capture current state
const booking = window.currentBooking;
const currentStaffId = getStaffId(allocationType, booking);
const currentBoatId = booking['Boat'] ? booking['Boat'][0] : null;

// After successful update
if (selectedStaffId && selectedStaffId !== currentStaffId) {
    // Staff changed - send SMS
    await sendAllocationSMS(/* params */);
} else {
    console.log('Staff unchanged, skipping SMS notification');
}
```

### Helper Function
```javascript
function getStaffId(type, booking) {
    if (type === 'onboarding') {
        return booking['Onboarding Employee'] ? 
               booking['Onboarding Employee'][0] : null;
    } else {
        return booking['Deloading Employee'] ? 
               booking['Deloading Employee'][0] : null;
    }
}
```

## Technical Details

### Variable Initialization Fix
Also fixed a JavaScript error where variables were accessed before initialization:

```javascript
// WRONG - causes "Cannot access before initialization" error
handleFormSubmit() {
    updateBooking();
    const currentStaffId = booking['Onboarding Employee'];
    const booking = window.currentBooking; // Error!
}

// CORRECT - declare variables first
handleFormSubmit() {
    const booking = window.currentBooking;
    const currentStaffId = booking['Onboarding Employee'];
    updateBooking();
}
```

### SMS Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Previous Staff | New Staff | Send SMS? |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Initial assignment | None | Josh | Yes |
| Staff change | Josh | Sarah | Yes |
| Add-on update | Josh | Josh | No |
| Boat change only | Josh | Josh | No |
| Remove staff | Josh | None | No* |

*Future enhancement: Consider notification for de-assignment

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Add-on Only Update
1. Assign Josh to booking
2. Josh accepts via SMS
3. Manager adds "Ice Bag" add-on
4. **Expected**: No SMS sent
5. **Result**: ✓ Confirmed working

### Test Case 2: Staff Change
1. Initial assignment to Josh
2. Manager changes to Sarah
3. **Expected**: SMS sent to Sarah
4. **Result**: ✓ Confirmed working

### Test Case 3: Multiple Updates
1. Change staff AND add-ons simultaneously
2. **Expected**: SMS sent (staff changed)
3. **Result**: ✓ Confirmed working

## Benefits

1. **Cost Reduction**: Fewer unnecessary SMS messages
2. **Better UX**: Staff not annoyed by duplicate notifications
3. **Clear Logic**: SMS only for meaningful changes
4. **Audit Trail**: Console logs show SMS decision reasoning

## Related Issues Fixed

### JavaScript Initialization Error
- **Error**: "Cannot access 'currentStaffId' before initialization"
- **Cause**: Variables declared after use in execution order
- **Fix**: Moved declarations to start of function

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification Preferences**: Allow staff to opt-in/out of update notifications
2. **Change Summary**: Include what changed in SMS (if multiple updates)
3. **Batch Updates**: Queue multiple changes before sending SMS
4. **Read Receipts**: Track if staff viewed the update
