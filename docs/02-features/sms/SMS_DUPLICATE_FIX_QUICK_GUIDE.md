# SMS Duplicate Fix - Quick Guide

## ✅ Fix Already Implemented!

The duplicate SMS reminder issue has been resolved. The system now uses existing Airtable fields to track reminder status, preventing duplicates across multiple Railway instances.

## How It Works

### For Shift Allocations
The system uses existing fields in the Shift Allocations table:
- **Reminder Sent**: Checkbox indicating a reminder was sent
- **Reminder Sent Date**: Timestamp of the last reminder

### For Booking Allocations
The system uses new fields in the Bookings Dashboard table:
- **Onboarding Reminder Sent** / **Onboarding Reminder Sent Date**
- **Deloading Reminder Sent** / **Deloading Reminder Sent Date**

## No Action Required

The fix is already deployed. The system will:
1. Check these fields before sending any reminder
2. Only send if 6+ hours have passed since the last reminder
3. Update the fields after sending

## Monitoring

You can verify the fix is working by:

1. **Check Airtable**: Look at the reminder fields in your allocations
2. **Admin Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/reminder-status?adminKey=your-key`
3. **SMS Logs**: Confirm no duplicates are being sent

## Benefits

- ✅ No more duplicate SMS
- ✅ Consistent 6-hour intervals
- ✅ Works across multiple app instances
- ✅ Reminder status visible in Airtable
- ✅ No extra configuration needed
