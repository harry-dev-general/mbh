# Vessel Checklist Links - Deployment Summary

## 🚀 Successfully Deployed to Production

### Changes Implemented

1. **My Schedule Page** (`training/my-schedule.html`)
   - Added "Vessel Checklist" section in shift details modal
   - Shows for booking allocations only (Onboarding/Deloading)
   - Links pass `bookingId` parameter to checklist pages

2. **Pre-Departure Checklist** (`training/pre-departure-checklist.html`)
   - Added URL parameter handling for `bookingId`
   - Auto-selects booking when accessed via My Schedule
   - Skips booking selection step

3. **Post-Departure Checklist** (`training/post-departure-checklist.html`)
   - Same enhancements as Pre-Departure
   - Auto-selects booking for Deloading allocations

### How It Works

```
Staff opens My Schedule → Clicks on booking allocation → Modal opens
→ Clicks "Complete Pre/Post-Departure Checklist" button
→ Navigates to checklist page with booking pre-selected
→ Staff fills out checklist immediately
```
