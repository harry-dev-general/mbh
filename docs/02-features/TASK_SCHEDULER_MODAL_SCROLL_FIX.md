# Task Scheduler Modal Scrolling Fix

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Updated By**: Development Team

## Issue
The task creation modal was experiencing scrolling problems where:
- Modal content was cut off at the bottom
- Scrolling attempted to scroll the background instead of the modal
- Users couldn't access the Save/Cancel buttons or bottom form fields

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modal Container Scrolling
```css
.modal {
    overflow-y: auto;  /* Allow scrolling within modal backdrop */
}

.modal-content {
    max-height: 90vh;  /* Limit height to 90% of viewport */
    overflow-y: auto;  /* Enable content scrolling */
}
```

### 2. Background Scroll Prevention
```javascript
// When opening modal
document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';

// When closing modal  
document.body.style.overflow = '';
```

### 3. Sticky Header and Footer
- Modal header stays at top while scrolling
- Modal footer stays at bottom with action buttons always visible
- Only the modal body scrolls between them

### 4. Mobile Optimizations
- Adjusted margins and max-height for mobile devices
- Better viewport utilization on small screens
- Responsive sizing for various device sizes

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes
- Added `max-height` constraints to modal content
- Implemented sticky positioning for header/footer
- Created scrollable container for modal body
- Added mobile-specific adjustments

### JavaScript Changes
- Modified `showCreateTaskModal()` to disable body scroll
- Modified `showEditTaskModal()` to disable body scroll  
- Modified `closeTaskModal()` to restore body scroll
- Existing click-outside-to-close functionality preserved

## Benefits
- All form fields are now accessible
- Smooth scrolling within the modal
- Background stays fixed preventing confusion
- Header with title and close button always visible
- Action buttons always accessible at bottom
- Better mobile experience
