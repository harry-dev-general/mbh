## Technical Implementation

  <!-- Day headers (Sun-Sat) -->
  <div class="calendar-header">Sun</div>
  ...
  <!-- Calendar days -->
  <div class="calendar-day">
    <div class="calendar-day-number">1</div>
    <div class="leave-block annual-leave">Employee Name</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Key Functions

2. **`renderMonthlyCalendar()`**: Builds calendar grid and populates leave
3. **`getLeaveForDate(dateStr)`**: Filters leave records for specific date
4. **`createLeaveBlock(leaveRecord)`**: Creates visual leave element
5. **`navigateMonth(direction)`**: Handles month navigation

### CSS Classes
- `.monthly-calendar`: Grid container (7 columns)

- `.calendar-day.today`: Current day highlight
- `.calendar-day.other-month`: Previous/next month days
- `.leave-block`: Base leave block styling
- `.leave-block.[type]`: Type-specific colors

## Usage

### For Managers
1. **View Team Leave**: Scroll down to see calendar below employee table
2. **Navigate Months**: Use arrows or "Today" button
3. **Check Details**: Click any leave block for full information
4. **Plan Coverage**: See overlapping leaves at a glance

### Creating Leave
1. Click "Leave" button for employee in table
2. Fill out form and submit
3. Calendar updates automatically
4. New leave appears immediately

### Understanding the Display
- **Block Position**: Leave spans all days from start to end date
- **Employee Name**: Truncated if too long (hover for full details)
- **Multiple Leaves**: Stack vertically on same day
- **Month Context**: Lighter days are from previous/next month

## Examples

### Single Day Leave
```
Sept 2: [Bronte Sprouster]
```

### Multi-Day Leave
```
Sept 2: [Bronte Sprouster]
Sept 3: [Bronte Sprouster]
Sept 4: [Bronte Sprouster]
Sept 5: [Bronte Sprouster]
Sept 6: [Bronte Sprouster]
```

### Overlapping Leave
```
Sept 15: [Max Mckelvey]
         [Luca Searl]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Leave Not Showing
1. **Check Status**: Only "Approved" leave displays
2. **Verify Dates**: Ensure dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. **Refresh Page**: May need to reload after creating leave
4. **Check Employee Link**: Leave must be linked to employee

### Performance
- Calendar renders ~42 days (6 weeks)
- May slow with many leaves per day
- Consider pagination for large teams

## Future Enhancements
1. **Week View Option**: Toggle between month/week
2. **Export Calendar**: Download as PDF/image
3. **Leave Conflicts**: Highlight understaffed days
4. **Recurring Leave**: Support for repeated patterns
5. **Leave Balance**: Show remaining days per employee
6. **Filter by Type**: Show/hide specific leave types
7. **Team Calendar**: Separate view for departments

## Mobile Responsiveness
Currently optimized for desktop viewing. Mobile improvements planned:
- Responsive grid for smaller screens
- Touch-friendly navigation
- Condensed leave blocks
- Swipe gestures for month navigation
