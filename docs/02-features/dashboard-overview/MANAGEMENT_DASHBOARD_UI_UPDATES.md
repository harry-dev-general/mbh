# Management Dashboard UI Updates

## Changes Made (September 2, 2025)

### 1. Removed Roster Planning Button
- **Location**: Staff Management tab
- **Reason**: Feature not yet implemented or no longer needed
- **Impact**: Cleaner interface with only essential management tools

### 2. Enhanced Active Tab Visibility
Added visual indicators to clearly show which tab is currently active:

#### Visual Changes:
- **Background Color**: Light red tint (rgba(220, 20, 60, 0.05))
- **Inner Shadow**: Subtle inset shadow for depth
- **Existing Features Retained**:
  - Red text color (#DC143C)
  - Red bottom border (3px)
  - Bold font weight (600)

#### CSS Implementation:
```css
.nav-tab.active {
    color: #DC143C;
    border-bottom-color: #DC143C;
    font-weight: 600;
    background: rgba(220, 20, 60, 0.05);
    box-shadow: 0 -2px 8px rgba(220, 20, 60, 0.1) inset;
}
```

## Benefits

### Improved User Experience
1. **Clear Navigation Context**: Users instantly know which section they're viewing
2. **Reduced Confusion**: No ambiguity about current location in the dashboard
3. **Professional Appearance**: Subtle but effective visual feedback

### Cleaner Interface
1. **Removed Unused Features**: Roster Planning button removed until needed
2. **Focused Options**: Only showing implemented and functional features

## Visual Guide

### Before:
- Active tab only had text color and bottom border
- Roster Planning button present but non-functional

### After:
- Active tab has background highlight and shadow
- Only functional management tools displayed

## Future Considerations

1. **Tab Icons**: Consider adding more distinctive icons
2. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure tab visibility on smaller screens
3. **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels for screen readers
4. **Animation**: Smooth transitions between tabs
