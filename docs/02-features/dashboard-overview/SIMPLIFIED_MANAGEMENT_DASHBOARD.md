## Technical Implementation

### Calendar Functions
```javascript
// Core calendar functions
- getMonday(date): Get Monday of the week
- formatWeekDisplay(date): Format week range for display
- changeWeek(direction): Navigate weeks (+1/-1)
- goToCurrentWeek(): Return to current week
- loadCalendarData(): Fetch bookings from Airtable
- renderScheduleGrid(): Build calendar grid

```

### Data Flow
1. On load, calendar defaults to current week
2. Fetches bookings from Airtable for the week
3. Filters for confirmed/paid bookings only
4. Renders grid with hourly slots
5. Places booking blocks in appropriate time slots

## Benefits of Simplification

3. **Filter Options**: Show/hide specific vessel types
4. **Export Calendar**: Download weekly schedule
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live booking changes

### Considerations
