# Task Scheduler FullCalendar Enhancements

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Updated By**: Development Team

## Overview
Major usability improvements have been implemented in the task scheduler using FullCalendar's advanced features, making the interface more intuitive and user-friendly.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Event Hover Tooltips
**Feature**: Hovering over any task shows a detailed tooltip with task information

**What's Displayed**:
- Task title and description
- Assigned employee
- Project name
- Priority level
- Current status
- Time range (formatted as "9:00am - 10:00am")

**Implementation**:
- 500ms delay before showing (prevents flickering)
- Smart positioning to avoid going off-screen
- Smooth fade in/out animations

### 2. Click-to-Create Tasks
**Feature**: Click any empty time slot to instantly create a task

**How It Works**:
- Single click on empty slot: Creates 1-hour task at that time
- Drag to select time range: Creates task for selected duration
- Pre-fills assignee based on current view/column
- Opens modal with time already set, cursor in title field

**Smart Defaults**:
- In individual employee view: Auto-assigns to that employee
- Click on resource column: Auto-assigns to that staff member
- Maintains context for faster task creation

### 3. Enhanced Drag & Drop Visual Feedback
**Feature**: Better visual cues during drag operations

**Visual Improvements**:
- Dragging tasks shows 75% opacity
- Mirror/ghost element shows where task will land
- Smooth 250ms revert animation if drag cancelled
- Auto-scroll when dragging near edges
- Touch support for mobile devices

**Snap Behavior**:
- Snaps to 15-minute intervals
- Visual grid helps align tasks precisely
- Minimum 5-pixel drag before activation (prevents accidental drags)

### 4. Right-Click Context Menu
**Feature**: Quick actions via right-click on any task

**Available Actions**:
- **Edit Task**: Opens edit modal (same as click)
- **Duplicate Task**: Creates copy with "(Copy)" suffix
- **Delete Task**: Removes task (with confirmation)
- **Change Status**: Quick status update without opening modal

**Implementation**:
- Context-aware positioning
- Keyboard accessible
- Touch-friendly on mobile (long-press)

### 5. Improved Event Display
**Feature**: Better visual representation of tasks

**Display Enhancements**:
- Shows both start and end times (e.g., "9:00am - 10:30am")
- Time format with minutes always shown for precision
- Maximum 3 events stacked in time grid before scrolling
- Color-coded borders based on priority
- Pointer cursor on hover

### 6. Event Popovers for Crowded Slots
**Feature**: Handles overlapping tasks gracefully

**How It Works**:
- When too many tasks overlap, shows "+2 more" link
- Click link to see all tasks in a popover
- Prevents cluttered display
- Maintains readability even with busy schedules

### 7. Date Range Selection
**Feature**: Drag to select multiple time slots

**Capabilities**:
- Click and drag to select time range
- Visual highlight shows selected area
- Creates task spanning selected time
- Works across multiple days
- Cancel with Escape key

### 8. Enhanced Keyboard Navigation
**Feature**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts

**Updated Shortcuts**:
- **Ctrl/Cmd + N**: Create new task
- **Ctrl/Cmd + F**: Focus search box
- **← → Arrow Keys**: Navigate employee tabs
- **Escape**: Close modals/cancel selection
- **? or H**: Show keyboard shortcuts help

**New Modal**: Beautiful keyboard shortcuts reference (replaced alert)

## Technical Details

### FullCalendar Configuration
```javascript
{
    // Interaction
    selectable: true,
    selectMirror: true,
    dateClick: handleDateClick,
    select: handleDateSelect,
    
    // Visual feedback
    eventDragMinDistance: 5,
    dragRevertDuration: 250,
    dragScroll: true,
    
    // Event display
    displayEventEnd: true,
    eventTimeFormat: {
        hour: 'numeric',
        minute: '2-digit',
        omitZeroMinute: false,
        meridiem: 'short'
    },
    
    // Hover effects
    eventMouseEnter: handleEventMouseEnter,
    eventMouseLeave: handleEventMouseLeave,
    
    // Crowded slots
    dayMaxEvents: true,
    moreLinkClick: 'popover',
    eventMaxStack: 3
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Tooltips use event delegation for efficiency
- Context menu is single instance, repositioned
- Debounced hover events prevent excessive renders
- Smart positioning calculations cached

## User Experience Improvements

### Task Creation Flow
1. **Faster**: Click empty slot → Modal opens with time pre-filled → Type title → Save
2. **Contextual**: Auto-assigns based on where you clicked
3. **Flexible**: Drag for custom duration, click for default 1 hour

### Information Access
1. **Quick Preview**: Hover for tooltip without clicking
2. **Full Details**: Click to open edit modal
3. **Bulk Actions**: Right-click for common operations

### Visual Clarity
1. **Time Display**: Always shows start and end times
2. **Priority Colors**: Visual hierarchy at a glance
3. **Hover States**: Clear interaction feedback
4. **Drag Preview**: See exactly where task will land

## Mobile Optimizations
- Touch-friendly tap targets
- Long-press for context menu
- Smooth scrolling during drag
- Responsive tooltip positioning
- Larger hit areas for task selection

## Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation for all features
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Focus management in modals
- Screen reader friendly tooltips
- High contrast mode compatible

## Browser Compatibility
All features tested and working on:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Mobile Safari (iOS)
- Chrome Mobile (Android)

## Migration Notes
- No database changes required
- Fully backward compatible
- Service worker already updated
- All existing tasks work with new features

## Future Enhancement Ideas
1. **Multi-Select**: Shift+Click to select multiple tasks
2. **Bulk Drag**: Move multiple selected tasks together
3. **Task Templates**: Right-click empty slot → Create from template
4. **Color Themes**: User-customizable event colors
5. **Advanced Filters**: Filter by multiple criteria simultaneously
6. **Timeline View**: Gantt-chart style project view
7. **Recurring Tasks**: Set daily/weekly/monthly patterns
8. **Task Dependencies**: Visual connections between related tasks

## Known Limitations
1. Tooltips may flicker on rapid mouse movement (500ms delay helps)
2. Context menu requires click outside to close (standard behavior)
3. Maximum 3 events stack in time grid (by design for clarity)
4. Touch devices use long-press instead of right-click
