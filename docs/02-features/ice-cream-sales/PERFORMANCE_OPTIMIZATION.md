# Ice Cream Sales Page - Performance Optimization

## Issue
The ice cream sales page was experiencing very slow loading times (several minutes) when fetching data from Airtable. This was causing the browser tab to show a continuous loading animation.

## Root Causes
1. **Airtable API Rate Limits**: Airtable enforces strict rate limits (5 requests/second per base)
2. **Network Latency**: High latency between Railway servers and Airtable API
3. **Large Payloads**: Fetching up to 100 records per request
4. **Parallel Requests**: Multiple simultaneous API calls overwhelming the rate limit
5. **No Caching**: Every page load makes fresh API calls

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Request Timeouts
- Added 30-second timeout for sales data fetches
- Added 15-second timeout for statistics fetches
- Show timeout-specific error messages with refresh button

### 2. Reduced Payload Size
- Decreased max records from 100 to 50 for sales data
- Limited stats queries to 20 records
- Smaller payloads = faster responses

### 3. Sequential Loading
- Changed from parallel to sequential API calls
- Added 500ms delay between calls to respect rate limits
- Prevents overwhelming Airtable's API

### 4. Smarter Refresh Strategy
- Increased auto-refresh interval from 30s to 60s
- Added manual refresh button for on-demand updates
- Pause refresh when tab is hidden to save resources

### 5. Data Caching
- Reuse existing sales data for stats when filter is "today"
- Avoid duplicate API calls for the same data
- Show loading spinner only on initial load

### 6. Better Error Handling
- Graceful timeout handling with user-friendly messages
- Continue with partial data rather than complete failure
- Refresh button in error states

## Code Changes

### Fetch with Timeout
```javascript
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 30000);

try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
        signal: controller.signal
    });
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
} catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'AbortError') {
        // Handle timeout
    }
}
```

### Sequential Loading
```javascript
await loadIceCreamSales();
setTimeout(() => {
    loadStats();
}, 500);
```

## Future Improvements

### Backend Caching
Consider implementing server-side caching in the Airtable proxy:
- Cache responses for 1-5 minutes
- Implement ETags for conditional requests
- Add compression to reduce payload size

### Pagination
For larger datasets:
- Implement pagination instead of loading all records
- Load more on scroll or button click
- Virtual scrolling for large tables

### Background Sync
- Use service workers for background data sync
- Store data in IndexedDB for offline access
- Show cached data immediately, update in background

## Performance Tips
1. Avoid opening multiple tabs with the portal
2. Use the manual refresh button during peak times
3. Filter by shorter date ranges to reduce data
4. Close the tab when not actively monitoring
