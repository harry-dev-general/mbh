# Ice Cream Sales Stats - Date Filter Fix

## Issue
The stat cards on the ice cream sales page were showing 0 sales and $0 revenue even though there was a test sale record for today.

## Root Cause
The Airtable "Sale Date" field uses a date type, and the simple equality filter `{Sale Date} = '2025-09-26'` wasn't working correctly. Through testing, we discovered that Airtable date fields require special comparison functions.

## Solution
Changed the date filter from:
```javascript
filterFormula = `{Sale Date} = '${formatDate(today)}'`;
```

To:
```javascript
filterFormula = `IS_SAME({Sale Date}, '${formatDate(today)}', 'day')`;
```

## Other Working Filters (for reference)
```javascript
// Range comparison
`AND({Sale Date} >= '2025-09-26', {Sale Date} < '2025-09-27')`

// Date string comparison
`DATESTR({Sale Date}) = '2025-09-26'`
```

## Changes Made

1. **Updated loadIceCreamSales()** - Fixed "today" filter to use IS_SAME
2. **Updated loadStats()** - Fixed today's stats filter to use IS_SAME
3. **Removed unused stat cards** - Only showing "Sales Today" and "Revenue Today"
4. **Improved stat card updates** - Now updates existing DOM instead of replacing all HTML
5. **Added debug logging** - To help diagnose future issues

## Stat Cards Now Display
- **Sales Today**: Shows count of ice cream sales for current day
- **Revenue Today**: Shows total revenue in dollars for current day

## Testing
The test sale created earlier now properly shows:
- 1 Sales Today
- $25.00 Revenue Today

## Note on Airtable Date Fields
When filtering Airtable date fields:
- Use `IS_SAME()` for exact date matching
- Simple equality (`=`) often fails with date fields
- Week/month filters using `>=` work correctly
- Always test date filters when working with Airtable
