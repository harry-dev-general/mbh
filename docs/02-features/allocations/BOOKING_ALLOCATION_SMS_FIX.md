# Booking Allocation SMS Notification Fix

## Issue
When trying to allocate staff to customer bookings via the redesigned modal, managers encountered the error:
```
Error updating allocation: sendStaffNotification is not defined
```

## Root Cause
During the booking allocation modal redesign, we attempted to call a `sendStaffNotification` function that:
1. Was never defined in the management-allocations.html file
2. Was likely removed or never implemented during the modal redesign
3. Was unnecessary since Airtable automations handle SMS notifications

## Solution
Removed the client-side SMS notification call from the booking allocation form submission.

### What Changed
- Removed lines attempting to call `sendStaffNotification`
- Added comment explaining that SMS notifications are handled by Airtable automations

### Why This Fix is Correct
1. **Airtable Handles SMS**: The existing Airtable automations already send SMS notifications when staff are assigned to bookings
2. **Consistency**: Other parts of the system rely on Airtable for SMS notifications
3. **Simplicity**: Removing redundant client-side SMS logic reduces complexity

## Technical Details
The fix was applied at line 2137-2139 in management-allocations.html:

```javascript
// Before (causing error):
if (selectedStaffId) {
    await sendStaffNotification(bookingId, selectedStaffId, allocationType);
}

// After (fixed):
// Note: SMS notifications are handled by Airtable automations
// when staff are assigned to bookings
```

## Verification
After this fix:
1. Managers can successfully allocate staff to bookings
2. Staff still receive SMS notifications via Airtable automations
3. No JavaScript errors occur during allocation
