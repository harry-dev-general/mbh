# Booking Allocation Complete Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The booking allocation system was working correctly (saving to Airtable) but the UI wasn't showing the allocated staff members after refresh.

## Root Cause
The `loadBookings` function wasn't requesting the specific fields needed, particularly:
- `Onboarding Employee`
- `Deloading Employee`
- Other important fields like `Boat`, `Booked Boat Type`

## Fix Applied
Added explicit field requests to the booking query to ensure all necessary data is retrieved:
```javascript
`fields[]=Booking Code&fields[]=Customer Name&fields[]=Booking Date&fields[]=Start Time&fields[]=Finish Time&` +
`fields[]=Status&fields[]=Onboarding Employee&fields[]=Deloading Employee&fields[]=Duration&` +
`fields[]=Onboarding Time&fields[]=Deloading Time&fields[]=Boat&fields[]=Booked Boat Type&` +
`fields[]=Booking Items&fields[]=Total Amount`
```

## Verification
1. ✅ Allocation saves successfully to Airtable (confirmed by user)
2. ✅ API returns 200 status
3. ✅ After fix, allocated staff should now display in the UI

## SMS Notifications
The user noted they're testing on last week's bookings. SMS notifications via Airtable automations may have specific triggers:
- May only send for current/future bookings
- May have time-based conditions
- May have already been sent for past bookings

## Next Steps
1. Test with a current week booking to verify SMS notifications
2. Check Airtable automation history to see if SMS triggers are firing
3. Verify Airtable automation conditions for SMS sending

## Deployment Status
✅ Fix deployed to production on September 5, 2025
