# Shift Allocation Deletion Feature

## Overview
Managers can now delete shift allocations directly from the management allocations dashboard. This feature is useful for removing incorrect allocations, cancelled shifts, or declined shifts that no longer need reassignment.

## Implementation Date
- August 29, 2025

## How It Works

### 1. Access Delete Function
- Click on any general shift allocation in the calendar view
- The reassignment modal opens with allocation details
- A red "Delete Shift" button appears in the modal footer (only for existing allocations)

### 2. Delete Process
When the "Delete Shift" button is clicked:
1. System confirms deletion with the user
2. If confirmed, sends DELETE request to Airtable API
3. Removes the allocation record from the Shift Allocations table
4. Displays success confirmation
5. Automatically refreshes the calendar view

### 3. Visual Indicators
- **Delete Button**: Red color, positioned on the left side of modal footer
- **Only visible**: When editing/reassigning existing allocations
- **Hidden**: When creating new allocations

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `/training/management-allocations.html`

### Key Functions
```javascript
// Delete shift allocation
async function deleteShiftAllocation() {
    // Gets allocation ID from form dataset
    // Confirms with user
    // Sends DELETE request to Airtable
    // Refreshes view on success
}
```

### API Call
```javascript
DELETE https://api.airtable.com/v0/{BASE_ID}/{TABLE_ID}/{ALLOCATION_ID}
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}
```

## User Experience

### For Managers
1. Click on a shift allocation (especially useful for declined shifts)
2. Modal opens showing current assignment and status
3. Choose to either:
   - Reassign to another employee
   - Delete the allocation entirely
4. If delete is chosen, confirm the action
5. View refreshes automatically

### Confirmation Dialog
- Message: "Are you sure you want to delete this shift allocation? This action cannot be undone."
- Options: OK (proceed) or Cancel (abort)

## Use Cases

### When to Delete Allocations
- **Declined shifts** that won't be reassigned
- **Scheduling errors** that need correction
- **Cancelled shifts** due to operational changes
- **Duplicate allocations** created by mistake
- **Test allocations** during system testing

### When NOT to Delete
- **Accepted shifts** - Consider reassigning instead
- **Customer booking allocations** - These should be managed through booking system
- **Historical records** needed for reporting

## Security Considerations
- Only managers with access to the management allocations page can delete
- Deletion is permanent (no soft delete/recovery)
- All deletions are logged in browser console
- Consider implementing audit trail in future

## Error Handling
- Network failures show user-friendly error message
- Invalid allocation IDs are caught and reported
- Modal remains open on error for retry
- Console logs provide debugging information

## Future Enhancements
1. **Audit Trail**: Log deletions to separate table
2. **Soft Delete**: Mark as deleted instead of removing
3. **Bulk Delete**: Select multiple allocations to delete
4. **Undo Feature**: Temporary recovery option
5. **Permissions**: Role-based deletion rights

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Delete button appears for existing allocations
- [ ] Delete button hidden for new allocations
- [ ] Confirmation dialog works
- [ ] Successful deletion removes from view
- [ ] Error handling for network issues
- [ ] View refreshes after deletion
- [ ] Cannot delete without confirmation

## Notes
- Deleted allocations cannot be recovered
- If employee was notified via SMS, they won't receive cancellation notice
- Consider sending cancellation SMS in future update
