# Booking Allocation Debugging Guide

## Issue
Staff allocations are not being saved when using the new booking allocation modal.

## What We've Done
1. Fixed the `sendStaffNotification` error
2. Added console logging to help diagnose the issue

## What to Test

### 1. Clear Cache and Reload
**IMPORTANT**: Clear your browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) to ensure you're using the latest code.

### 2. Check Console on Page Load
When the page loads, you should see:
```
Booking allocation form found, attaching submit handler
```

If you see "Booking allocation form not found!" instead, there's a DOM issue.

### 3. Try Allocating Staff
1. Click on a customer booking allocation (e.g., "ON Mackelagh Spence")
2. Select a staff member from the dropdown
3. Click "Update Allocation"

### 4. Expected Console Output
You should see:
```
Booking allocation form submitted
Form values: { bookingId: "...", allocationType: "onboarding", selectedStaffId: "...", selectedBoatId: "" }
Updating booking with fields: { 'Onboarding Employee': ["..."] }
API response status: 200
```

### What to Report Back
Please share:
1. Any error messages in the console
2. Whether you see the "form submitted" message
3. The full console output when attempting to allocate staff
4. Whether the success alert appears

## Possible Issues
- **No console output at all**: The form submission event isn't firing
- **"Form submitted" but no API call**: There's an error in the form processing logic
- **API error**: Airtable is rejecting the update

## SMS Notifications
SMS notifications are handled by Airtable automations, not the client-side code. Once the allocation is saved successfully, Airtable should automatically send the SMS.
