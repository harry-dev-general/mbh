# Staff Allocation System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ What Was Built

### 1. **Management Allocation Dashboard** (`management-allocations.html`)
A comprehensive interface for management to:
- View all staff availability from the Roster table
- See today's bookings requiring staff assignment
- Create hourly shift allocations for staff
- Assign staff to specific bookings with defined roles
- View weekly schedule grid with all allocations
- Quick-create shifts by clicking on time slots

**Key Features:**
- Weekly calendar view with navigation
- Staff availability sidebar showing who's available
- Bookings panel showing staffing needs
- Modal form for creating allocations
- Color-coded shift types (General, Booking-specific, Maintenance, etc.)

### 2. **Staff Schedule View** (`my-schedule.html`)
A personalized dashboard where staff can:
- View their weekly shift schedule
- See shift details including times, type, and customer info
- Track total hours and number of shifts
- Switch between calendar and list views
- Navigate between weeks

**Key Features:**
- Statistics cards (total shifts, hours, bookings)
- Calendar view with daily shift blocks
- List view grouped by day
- Mobile-responsive design
- Auto-linking to employee record via email

### 3. **Dashboard Integration**
Updated the main dashboard to include:
- Link to "My Schedule" for all staff
- Management-only "Staff Allocation" button
- Role-based visibility (management emails see allocation tool)

### 4. **Documentation**
Created comprehensive guides:
- `STAFF_ALLOCATION_SETUP.md` - Complete setup instructions
- `create-shift-allocations-table.js` - Script to help create Airtable structure
- This summary document

## üîÑ How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **Roster Table** ‚Üí Shows weekly availability submitted by staff
2. **Management Views** ‚Üí Available staff and creates allocations
3. **Shift Allocations Table** ‚Üí Stores all shift assignments (needs creation)
4. **Staff Views** ‚Üí Their personal schedules from allocations
5. **Bookings Integration** ‚Üí Links specific shifts to customer bookings

### Key Integrations
- **Supabase Auth**: User authentication and email verification
- **Airtable API**: All data storage and retrieval
- **Existing Tables**: Employee Details, Roster, Bookings Dashboard
- **New Table Required**: Shift Allocations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Next Steps Required

### 1. **Create Shift Allocations Table in Airtable**
**This is required for the system to work!**

Follow the instructions in `STAFF_ALLOCATION_SETUP.md` to:
1. Create the new table with all required fields
2. Get the table ID from Airtable
3. Update both HTML files with the correct table ID

### 2. **Update Management Emails**
In `dashboard.html`, update the management email list (lines 369-373):
```javascript
const managementEmails = [
    'your-email@domain.com',  // Add actual management emails
    'manager@mbh.com',
    // ... more emails
];
```

### 3. **Test the System**
1. Create the Shift Allocations table
2. Add test allocations
3. Verify staff can see their schedules
4. Test booking assignments

## üìä Current State

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Management allocation interface
- Staff schedule viewer
- Dashboard integration
- Roster availability display
- Booking integration setup
- Documentation

### ‚è≥ Pending
- Shift Allocations table creation in Airtable
- Table ID configuration
- Management email list update
- Production testing

### üîÆ Future Enhancements
- Real-time updates with webhooks
- Conflict detection (prevent double-booking)
- Shift templates for common patterns
- Time clock integration
- Payroll report generation
- Push notifications for schedule changes

## üöÄ Deployment

Since your portal is already live on Railway, these new features will be available immediately after:
1. Creating the Airtable table
2. Updating the table IDs
3. Configuring management emails

The files are already in place and will work once the Airtable structure is set up.

## üìù Notes

- The system currently shows sample data when the Shift Allocations table doesn't exist
- All authentication and security measures are already in place
- The UI is fully responsive and works on mobile devices
- Color coding helps distinguish between shift types and booking assignments
