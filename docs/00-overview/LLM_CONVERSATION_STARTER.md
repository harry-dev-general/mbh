## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "fix the booking system", say "fix the issue where staff assignments aren't showing on the calendar"

2. **Provide Context**: Mention what you've already tried or what error messages you're seeing

3. **Reference Documentation**: If you know a feature exists, mention it so the LLM can find relevant docs

4. **Include Console Logs**: If you have error messages or console output, include them

5. **Mention the Date**: The system uses "September 10, 2025" as the current date in examples

## Follow-up Prompts

After the initial setup, you can use these follow-ups:

- "What's the current implementation of [feature]?"
- "Show me the documentation for [topic]"
- "What's the best practice for [task] in this project?"
- "Are there any similar features I can reference?"
- "What should I test after making this change?"

*Remember: The LLM will perform better if you give it time to read the documentation files. Don't rush into coding without context.*
