# Boat Type Filtering Fix Summary

**Date**: September 4, 2025

## Problem

The boat type filtering wasn't working because:
1. The "Booked Boat Type" formula field doesn't exist in Airtable (API doesn't support creating formula fields)
2. The code was trying to read a non-existent field

## Solution Implemented

Updated the code to parse boat types directly from the "Booking Items" field:

```javascript
// Parse boat type from Booking Items field
const bookingItems = (booking['Booking Items'] || '').toLowerCase();
let bookedBoatType = '';

if (bookingItems.includes('12person')) {
    bookedBoatType = '12 Person BBQ Boat';
} else if (bookingItems.includes('8person')) {
    bookedBoatType = '8 Person BBQ Boat';
} else if (bookingItems.includes('4person')) {
    bookedBoatType = '4 Person Polycraft';
}
```

## Features Now Working

1. **Calendar Display**: Shows boat type with ⚓ icon in booking blocks
2. **Sidebar List**: Displays boat type badges for each booking
3. **Modal Filtering**: When opening a booking allocation:
   - Shows the customer's booked boat type in the summary
   - Filters the boat dropdown to only show matching vessels
   - Displays an info message about the filtering

## Debug Information

The console now logs:
- `Booking Items: [raw value]`
- `Parsed Boat Type: [parsed type]`
- `Available boats: [all boats with types]`
- `Filtered boats: [matching boats only]`

## Next Steps

For better data consistency, you should manually create a formula field in Airtable:
1. Go to "Bookings Dashboard" table
2. Add field "Booked Boat Type" as Formula type
3. Use the formula provided in `AIRTABLE_BOAT_TYPE_SETUP.md`

This will centralize the boat type logic and improve reporting capabilities.

## Testing

Try clicking on different bookings:
- Bookings with "12personbbqboat" items → Should show only 12 Person BBQ Boats
- Bookings with "8personbbqboat" items → Should show only 8 Person BBQ Boats
- Bookings with "4personpolycraft" items → Should show only 4 Person Polycrafts
- Bookings without items → Should show all boats
