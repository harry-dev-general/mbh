# CRITICAL: Railway Registry Infrastructure Failure

## Issue Summary
Railway's docker registry for project `4f5a2937-91c1-4754-a858-0f03f6b8af2f` is completely broken. ALL environments (production, development, and newly created) route to the same failed registry.

## Evidence
- Build Phase: Completes in <1 minute ✅
- Docker Push: Fails with "connection reset by peer" ❌
- Registry: `production-us-west2.railway-registry.com` (162.220.232.123:443)
- Affects: ALL environments in the project

## Timeline
- September 24, 2025: Issue began after pushing to production
- September 25, 2025: Confirmed project-wide registry failure

## Attempted Solutions (All Failed)
1. ✗ Switched branch from main to development
2. ✗ Created custom Dockerfile
3. ✗ Removed large files (repo now 29MB)
4. ✗ Created new Railway environment
5. ✗ All workarounds failed - registry is project-wide

## Root Cause
Railway's registry infrastructure at `production-us-west2.railway-registry.com` is dropping connections for this project.

## URGENT Actions Required

### Option 1: Create New Railway Project
1. Create new Railway project
2. Import GitHub repo
3. Copy environment variables
4. Update domain settings

### Option 2: Contact Railway Support NOW

## Technical Details
