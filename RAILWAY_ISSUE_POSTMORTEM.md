# Railway Registry Issue - Post-Mortem

## Executive Summary
Railway's Docker registry infrastructure (`production-us-west2.railway-registry.com`) experienced a service failure that prevented deployments for ~3 days. The issue has been resolved by Railway.

## Timeline
- **Sept 24, 2025**: First production deployment attempt failed
- **Sept 24-25, 2025**: Multiple troubleshooting attempts
- **Sept 25, 2025 AM**: Issue escalated, documented comprehensively
- **Sept 25, 2025 PM**: Railway resolved infrastructure issue
- **Sept 25, 2025 PM**: Successful deployment confirmed

## Root Cause
Railway's Docker registry service at `production-us-west2.railway-registry.com` (IP: 162.220.232.123) was dropping connections during the push phase.

## Impact
- All deployments blocked for ~3 days
- Affected ALL environments in project
- Build phase worked (proving code was fine)
- Only registry push failed

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✗ Branch switching (main → development)
2. ✗ Custom Dockerfile
3. ✗ Repository optimization (removed 4.3MB)
4. ✗ New Railway environment
5. ✗ Various workarounds
6. ✓ Railway fixed their infrastructure

## Lessons Learned
1. **Not always your code**: Infrastructure providers can fail
2. **Document thoroughly**: Our detailed logs helped identify the issue
3. **Have backup plans**: Alternative platforms identified
4. **Escalate when needed**: Bot responses aren't always helpful

## Action Items
- [x] Document issue comprehensively
- [x] Successfully deploy after fix
- [ ] Consider backup deployment strategy
- [ ] Monitor for recurrence

## Prevention
- Keep deployment alternatives ready (Render, Vercel, etc.)
- Monitor Railway status page
- Document deployment issues immediately
- Build reproducible deployment processes

## Conclusion
This was a Railway infrastructure failure, not a code issue. The systematic troubleshooting and documentation helped identify the true cause and will help if similar issues arise.
